    "# Final Output & Analysis\n",
    "### <u>Introduction:</u>\n",
    "In this exercise, I will be scraping IMDB movies to collect the movie data such as it's title, ratings and most importantly, the user reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Data Source:</u>\n",
    "As a huge fan of the Sci-Fi movie genre, I decided to collect the Top 100 Sci-Fi movies that a [user curated together](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls026827286/?sort=list_order,asc&st_dt=&mode=simple&page=1&ref_=ttls_vw_smp). I chose **not** to use IMDB's list of 'top movies as the user curated list has not only identical HTML elements, but contains exactly 100 movies on one page whereas the default ['Top Movies'](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&num_votes=25000,&genres=sci-fi&view=simple) page shows only 50 by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Collection Methods:</u>\n",
    "The scraping process for extracting these movie metadata out of IMDB's website really boils down to 3 steps detailed below:\n",
    "- 1. **Extracting the list of Movie URLs**: Using the BeautifulSoup library, the URL to the user curated list of 100 top sci-fi movies was fed in and then looped to extract IMDB's individual movie links.  \n",
    "- 2. **Using Movie URLs to get Review URL**: Once every movie's URL page was stored into memory, that list of URL was then re-fed into another loop that pulled each movie's review page URL. Luckily, no browser-automation (ex. Selenium) was required to extract each link as not only the HTML element was consistent across all movie URLs but the location of the review was a HTML page in itself labeled as 'reviews'.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    For example if the movie URL for the movie 'Alien' was _(home url)/title/tt0078748/_, the the review page for that movie would simply be _(home url)/title/tt0078748/reviews_. However, the next challenge was that the /review/ page only provided us a page of ALL user reviews and so to extract each individual user review, each review page was fed into another loop to extract each user review's permalink. \n",
    "- 3. **Using the Review URLs to scrape the review text**: Once we were able to get a list of user reviews per movie and their respective rating, there was a business case to only have 1 review per movie and so we randomlly selected one of the reviews from a list of reviews. After each movie was then associated to 1 random review permalink, extracting the actual review for was as simple as pulling the tag's text using (tag.text).  \n",
