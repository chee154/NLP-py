Ad Astra|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5142538/|8|"Let me start off by saying that the movie's pacing is unusual (think of the pacing of Interstellar; constant progress), but unlike Interstellar, this movie's climax is not as strong- but that's not a bad thing.The whole movie is about how Brad Pitt is calm on the outside, but inside he is a storm of feelings. This can be a metaphor for space itself- always quiet, but is very complex inside.The end of the movie (without spoiling it) also works with that logic- there is no loud Inception horn, in fact, seemingly it's pretty relaxed, but you can still sense the tension and emotions going on.Now that's what I call ""show don't tell"""|"['me', ""the movie's pacing"", 'the pacing', 'Interstellar', 'constant progress', 'Interstellar', ""this movie's climax"", 'a bad thing', 'The whole movie', 'Brad Pitt', 'the outside', 'he', 'a storm', 'feelings', 'a metaphor', 'space', 'The end', 'the movie', 'it', 'that logic-', 'no loud Inception horn', 'fact', 'it', 'you', 'the tension', 'emotions', 'what', 'I', '""show']"

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0156284/|10|I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10|['I', 'a favorite movie', 'different movies', 'different effects', 'Goodfellas', 'my favorite drama', 'Face/Off', 'my favorite actioner', 'it', 'pure amazement', 'nothing', 'Star Wars', 'We', 'a whole other universe', 'different creatures', 'different lifestyles', 'different history', 'We', 'the middle', 'an intergalactic war', 'an empire', 'a rebellion', 'years', 'the universe', 'ruin', 'It', 'the most fascinating thing', 'i', 'this day', 'i', 'a Star Wars nerd', 'The cast', 'characters', 'funniest', 'film', 'the actors', 'who', 'them', 'this new universe', 'Alec Guiness', 'Obi-Wan Kenobi', 'a Jedi', 'the run', 'the evil Empire', 'Harrison Ford', 'Han Solo', 'a smuggler', 'thief', 'who', 'the gang', 'the princess', 'the my favorite character', 'all time', 'Darth Vader', 'he', 'the coolest bad guy', 'we', 'later films', 'he', 'him', 'badass booming voice', 'a pizza sound', 'only the beginning', 'the best movie series', 'it', 'the beginning', 'my love', 'movies', 'George Lucas', 'a genius', 'a great story', 'an incredible backdrop', 'what', 'a flop', 'the best films']
12 Monkeys|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5718067/|9|Twelve Monkeys is a science fiction movie directed by Terry Gilliam and stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer and David Morse.After watching the trailer and first few minutes of the movie I thought that this is probably one of the most overrated movie but the movie kept proving me wrong as soon as it progresses and by the time it's reaches it's heartbreaking climax I was sure that I was about to make a terrible mistake by under judging this great movie.Acting is one of the most strongest aspect of the movie and probably this is one of the finest work by Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. The plot of the movie is complex but will not disappoint you. The screenplay is gripping and thought provoking.This is one of the finest work of cinema I have seen and a must watch.|['Twelve Monkeys', 'a science fiction movie', 'Terry Gilliam', 'Bruce Willis', 'Madeleine Stowe', 'Brad Pitt', 'Christopher Plummer', 'David Morse', 'the trailer', 'first few minutes', 'the movie', 'I', 'the most overrated movie', 'the movie', 'me', 'it', 'the time', 'it', 'it', 'heartbreaking climax', 'I', 'I', 'a terrible mistake', 'this great movie', 'Acting', 'the most strongest aspect', 'the movie', 'the finest work', 'Bruce Willis', 'Brad Pitt', 'The plot', 'the movie', 'you', 'The screenplay', 'the finest work', 'cinema', 'I']
Dark City|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2127758/|9|simply wonderful on every level. A matrix meets Truman show if you will. Remarkably the film works despite its weird. wonderful and uncomfortable story line. Genuinely disturbing, as interesting as any murder mystery and beautiful atmosphere with art deco, film noir, and night on elm street under belly.At first you will be tempted to draw comparisons with the matrix and at other times the mind wonders and the ghostly tall men enter our dreams, but as the film progresses the human heart begins to take centre stage particularly in the characters of the two police chiefs as well as the central figure of John Murdoch. All in all a cascading and multi-dimensional cinematic delight that left me feeling unsettled and warm at the same time.watch it.|['every level', 'A matrix', 'Truman', 'you', 'the film', 'wonderful and uncomfortable story line', 'any murder mystery', 'beautiful atmosphere', 'art deco', 'film noir', 'night', 'elm street', 'belly', 'you', 'comparisons', 'the matrix', 'other times', 'the mind wonders', 'the ghostly tall men', 'our dreams', 'the film', 'the human heart', 'centre stage', 'the characters', 'the two police chiefs', 'the central figure', 'John Murdoch', 'multi-dimensional cinematic delight', 'me', 'the same time.watch', 'it']
Mad Max: Fury Road|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5829190/|5|Mad Max: Fury Road did not appeal to me in the slightest.I chose to watch this film as it featured the great Tom Hardy and had a decent 8.1 IMDb rating but was disappointed.The plot was basic and simple - driving through the desert for 2+ hours. This bored me and I was waiting for the movie to end.I also believed that the attempts to achieve style were flawed - such as the pointless guitarist (?).This is just my opinion as I am aware many people love this film, but personally I just didn't get it.|['Mad Max', 'Fury Road', 'me', 'I', 'this film', 'it', 'the great Tom Hardy', 'a decent 8.1 IMDb rating', 'The plot', 'basic and simple - driving', 'the desert', '2+ hours', 'me', 'I', 'the movie', 'I', 'the attempts', 'style', 'the pointless guitarist', 'my opinion', 'I', 'many people', 'this film', 'I', 'it']
Arrival|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5560834/|10|"""I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time"", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use ""the weapon"".There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.Easily a 10/10"|"['I', 'the beginning', 'your story', 'We', 'time', 'Dr. Louise Banks', 'the first 30 seconds', 'the film', 'I', 'the true theme', 'the whole movie', 'Arrival', 'its core', 'the power', 'language', 'how much language shapes', 'who', 'we', 'what', 'we', 'we', 'the world', 'us', 'the alien race', 'earth', 'Dr. Banks', 'their language', 'them', 'they', 'she', 'she', 'they', 'we', 'we', 'She', 'the aliens', 'time', 'the humans', 'Dr. Banks', 'the weapon""', 'dialogue', 'Ian', 'Dr. Banks', 'the film', 'they', 'the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis', 'you', 'a foreign language', 'you', 'your brain', 'the language', 'you', 'you', 'Dr. Banks', 'this alien language', 'she', 'the knowledge', 'they', 'time', 'This theme', 'the whole movie', 'her daughter', 'the spelling', 'her daughters name', 'Hannah', 'more sense', 'the film', 'the big reveal', 'the end', 'the true beauty', 'the viewer', 'the knowledge', 'Dr. Banks', 'we', 'the story', 'itself', 'the beginning', 'the movie', 'the end', 'We', 'the beginning', 'it', 'the beginning', 'you', 'we', 'Dr. Banks', 'what', 'she', 'we', 'time', 'The question', 'you', 'your life', 'end', 'you', 'anything', 'This movie', 'an alien invasion', 'we', 'a thousand times', 'It', 'Arrival', 'the art']"
2001: A Space Odyssey|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1316931/|1|2001 is the perfect movie for a certain group of people. You know who they are. Over the internet, in your college maybe--a student or possibly a philosophy/art/film professor. A person with a passion for avante-garde films with wacky imagery and little else. They're the type of people who find a college thesis' worth of material from the dialogue in the Matrix sequels, they're the ones that boldly declare a film 'art' and anybody else who disagrees with them 'just didn't get it.' 2001 is art alright. The kind of art that I can only liken as being assaulted and nearly beaten to death by an Andy Warhol painting. Yes this movie is art, and you will hate it for that.This is a shame since normally I like Stanley Kubrick movies, but 2001 is an experiment in film-making and nothing more. The plot is incredibly vague, revolving around monkeys battling a black monolith, a mission to space, and a computer program called Hal going insane since that's what most self-conscious computer programs do. The film is then peppered with other psychedelic imagery that are supposed to convey grand ideas. They'll only convey those types of things if you're pretentious and into that kind of thing, otherwise you'll view it as utterly pointless.2001 revolves around these whacked-out, LSD-induced images to string together some kind of story that interests you. It does not. A parade of shots that have little to do with one another and randomly show things happen does not a movie make.There are no doubt going to be people out there who will try to explain 2001's plot and why you should accept it as being a wonderful film. The thing is this: much like if you have to explain a joke then it isn't funny, it's the same thing with movies. If you have to explain to someone the plot and its various interpretations, then it isn't a good movie.Ultimately I can't change the opinion of the viewers and critics that loved 2001, but if 2001 proves anything it's this: keep your art to yourself.|"['the perfect movie', 'a certain group', 'people', 'You', 'who', 'they', 'the internet', 'your college', 'a student', 'possibly a philosophy/art/film professor', 'A person', 'a passion', 'avante-garde films', 'wacky imagery', 'They', 'the type', 'people', 'who', ""a college thesis' worth"", 'material', 'the dialogue', 'the Matrix sequels', 'they', 'the ones', ""a film 'art"", 'anybody', 'who', 'them', 'it', 'art alright', 'The kind', 'art', 'I', 'death', 'an Andy Warhol painting', 'this movie', 'art', 'you', 'it', 'a shame', 'I', 'Stanley Kubrick movies', 'an experiment', 'film-making', 'nothing', 'The plot', 'monkeys', 'a black monolith', 'a mission', 'space', 'a computer program', 'Hal', 'what', 'most self-conscious computer programs', 'The film', 'other psychedelic imagery', 'grand ideas', 'They', 'those types', 'things', 'you', 'that kind', 'thing', 'you', 'it', 'pointless.2001', 'these whacked-out', ', LSD-induced images', 'some kind', 'story', 'you', 'It', 'A parade', 'shots', 'things', 'a movie', 'people', 'who', ""2001's plot"", 'you', 'it', 'a wonderful film', 'The thing', 'you', 'a joke', 'it', 'it', 'the same thing', 'movies', 'you', 'someone', 'the plot', 'its various interpretations', 'it', 'a good movie', 'I', 'the opinion', 'the viewers', 'critics', 'anything', 'it', 'your art', 'yourself']"
Total Recall|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1382615/|8|"When a man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes for virtual vacation memories of the planet Mars, an unexpected and harrowing series of events forces him to go to the planet for real, or does he?One could consider ""Total Recall"" part of a Philip K. Dick trilogy: Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report. With A Scanner Darkly and Paycheck (among others) creating an extended trilogy (you know, like Douglas Adams did). Total Recall is easily worthy of standing beside Blade Runner. And even as a stand-alone sci-fi film, it ranks as one of the better ones of the 1990s, if not all time.One of the great things about Total Recall is the ambiguous nature of the story. Is it a dream? A brain embolism? Reality? Any of these has evidence to support it and also to contradict it. And this is a strength for the movie.There is a certain absurdity with the special effects -- eyes bulging and whatnot when the people lose oxygen. In real life you would simply die in space, not explode. But at the same time this was somewhat amusing and a bit comical so it can be overlooked. Besides, coming from Rob Bottin (""The Thing""), the focus should be on the strengths of the makeup and effects and not the possible shortfalls.The casting was great. Arnold was a great choice, and no one else could be Quaid. Kurt Russell, Stallone, Swayze... these guys are great but not right for this part. And Sharon Stone was looking her best for this movie, and since her role seemed to be the sexpot wife who does little more than exercise and seduce her husband, that is a big endorsement.Clearly the best character was Benny the Cab Driver, played by Mel Johnson, Jr in his only notable role. He stole the scenes he was in with great comic timing and an interesting back-story. I was quite interested by how he went from being what could have been a minor background role to a primary figure in the overall plot. Exquisite.I guess I simply must recommend you see this movie. If you have not seen Blade Runner, watch that first. If you have not seen Minority Report, watch this first. But either way, be sure that you put this movie somewhere high on your to-do list."|"['a man', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'virtual vacation memories', 'the planet', 'Mars', 'an unexpected and harrowing series', 'events', 'him', 'the planet', 'real', 'he?One', '""Total Recall"" part', 'a Philip K.

Blade Runner|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1123645/|10|I have an interest in science fiction films and TV programmes. I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself. Blade Runner is a Must-Watch, and a Must-Have film.My rating: 8.9 / 10 Thank you for your time.

Gattaca|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1827647/|10|"This movie is rife with symbolism. I show it to my biology classes every year. After seeing it 6x per year during each class, for eight years, it never ceases to amaze me how I see something new and different each time I watch it. This year, I noticed the themes of swimming and stars:SWIMMING: Eugene - an Olympic swimmer; the swimming competition between Anton and Vincent-- and later Anton working out in a lap pool because he has never come to grips with the fact that Vincent beat him swimming. I wonder why the swimming theme was used in the screen play? My students have hypothesized that perhaps it means a ""baptism"" or ""cleansing"" but that's all speculation.STARS: ""Reach for the stars"" -- setting high goals for yourself and working to achieve them. Stars are shown several times as they gaze into the sky Titan is the destination -- a moon of Saturn which appears as a star in our telescopes Astronauts ""They say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving, maybe I'm going home."" -- a quote by Vincent.Last year I realized for the first time the names of the characters: ""Eugene"" - or ""True Gene"" ""Eu""= truth and ""gene"" = to create or to cause.Vincent's last name is ""Freeman"" ... free from being a prisoner of DNA as he escapes its grasp and uses his spirit and determination to succeed. (I felt stupid never thinking about those names before.)The more you watch the movie, the more you begin to see.My students' favorite part every year is how the silver medal turns ""gold"" as seen through the flames of the incinerator.Age discrimination is another theme that is subtle. The ""in-valids"" they are testing in town are all older fellows, the killed director was young, his replacement under him, was old. The detective was older, and his boss Anton, was young."|"['This movie', 'symbolism', 'I', 'it', 'my biology classes', 'it', 'year', 'each class', 'eight years', 'it', 'me', 'I', 'something', 'I', 'it', 'I', 'the themes', 'swimming', 'stars', 'SWIMMING', 'Eugene - an Olympic swimmer', 'the swimming competition', 'Anton', 'Anton', 'a lap pool', 'he', 'grips', 'the fact', 'Vincent', 'him', 'swimming', 'I', 'the swimming theme', 'the screen play', 'My students', 'it', 'a ""baptism', '""cleansing', 'speculation', 'STARS', 'the stars', 'high goals', 'yourself', 'them', 'Stars', 'several times', 'they', 'the sky', 'Titan', 'the destination', 'a moon', 'Saturn', 'a star', 'our telescopes', 'Astronauts', 'They', 'every atom', 'our bodies', 'a part', 'a star', 'I', 'I', '-- a quote', 'Vincent', 'I', 'the first time', 'the names', 'the characters', ': ""Eugene', '""True Gene', 'Eu""= truth', '""gene', ""Vincent's last name"", '""Freeman', 'a prisoner', 'DNA', 'he', 'its grasp', 'his spirit', 'determination', 'I', 'those names', 'you', 'the movie', 'you', ""My students' favorite part"", 'the silver medal', 'gold', 'the flames', 'the incinerator', 'Age discrimination', 'another theme', 'The ""in-valids', 'they', 'town', 'older fellows', 'the killed director', 'his replacement', 'him', 'The detective', 'his boss', 'Anton']"
The Terminator|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0216010/|10|"The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10"|"['The Terminator', 'those films', 'you', 'it', 'you', 'it', 'you', 'at least one or two lines', 'it', 'the movie', ""new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career"", 'James Cameron', 'Hollywood', 'new meaning', 'a possible dark future', 'us', 'nightmares', 'I', 'the first time', 'I', 'this movie', 'I', 'my dad', 'course', 'my eyes', 'every ""bad"" scene', 'violence', 'nudity', 'about 70%', 'the movie', 'he', 'my eyes', 'I', 'it', 'my mom', 'I', 'love', 'just an action movie', 'it', 'it', 'a story', 'just a quick nightmare', 'James Cameron', 'he', 'much money', 'he', 'a good script', 'a great crew', 'his side', ""cinema's greatest movies"", 'all time', 'Two men', 'Los Angeles', 'separate locations', 'flash-storms', 'electricity', 'the other man', 'The mysterious muscular man', 'weapons', 'all women', '""Sarah Connor', 'a phone book', 'his targets', 'He', 'the three listed women', 'he', 'the last Sarah Connor', 'he', 'the other man', 'Kyle Reese', 'who', 'time', 'her', 'a parking garage', 'Reese', 'the man', 'Sarah', 'a cyborg assassin', 'a ""Terminator', 'Skynet', 'an artificial intelligence network', 'Cyberdyne Systems', 'the near future', 'Reese', 'Skynet', 'self-awareness', 'a global takeover', 'military hardware', 'a nuclear war', 'humanity', 'Skynet', 'a scant number', 'humans', 'order', 'slave labor', 'John Connor', ""Sarah's son"", 'the few remaining humans', 'a resistance movement', 'the machines', 'a grinding campaign', 'the human resistance', 'the verge', 'victory', 'a last-ditch effort', 'Skynet', 'the Terminator', 'time', 'Sarah', 'John', 'the resistance', 'the machines', 'default', 'the Terminator', 'time', 'Sarah', 'his use', 'the time transportation equipment', 'it', 'the resistance', 'order', 'further Terminators', 'time', 'The Terminator', 'no pain', 'no emotions', 'nothing', 'its mission', 'The Terminator', 'my favorite movies', 'all time', 'I', 'this movie', 'something', 'the effects', ""very 80's"", 'the time', 'this day', 'I', 'the special effects', 'the CGI crud', 'we', ""today's cinema"", 'everything', 'action', 'romance', 'horror', 'sci', 'fi', 'even some dark humor', 'The reason', 'Arnold', 'I', 'his accent', 'you', 'something', 'me', 'you', 'you', 'The Terminator', 'I', 'this movie', 'it', 'an incredible one', 'entertainment', 'the greatest movies', 'all time', 'I', 'you', 'you', 'a CAT']"
Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0982704/|10|The first time I saw this at a friends recommendation was in 1985 on our brand new VHS vcr. I was absolutely blown away by it at the age of 16 and I still watch every few months on DVD now.I would give anything to see this on a big screen. This movie started a real trend for a lot of real crappy B movies to follow unfortunately and Mel Gibson has called this movie with an apologetic shrug 'classy B-grade trash' which is sad because it would prove to be his best movie by far. What I truly liked about this film was its lack of dialogue and how it was smart enough to let its settings, action and costumes do the talking. Perhaps this is why Gibson didn't have much praise for it because he is merely a representation of the Western gunslinger in the film. I liked how there was a sketchy explanation of how the world got into such an apocalyptic mess and lets the viewer make their own conclusion to that end. It's not important anyways. The lack of ammunition is indicated quickly through the Wez's use of a wrist-strapped crossbow, the very preciousness of gasoline is established quickly as well by Max's anxious mopping up of it and capturing it in a few make-shift items including a dusty soldier's helmet.The original Mad Max had too much dialogue and proved problematic for the 18 year old Gibson to convey the emotion of losing his family and best friend. It had it's moments but in the end it lost it's impact due to it's own clumsy attempt at trying to establish the family-man Max. The Road Warrior didn't try to attempt any deep characterizations, the pain and suffering was quick and obvious, the need to just survive in this stark world conveyed through a few spoken words and violent actions. George Miller got it right with this one, unfortunately he had to make Mad Max first to get to Mad MaxII and horribly had to make Mad MaxIII.|"['The first time', 'I', 'a friends recommendation', 'our brand', 'new VHS vcr', 'I', 'it', 'the age', 'I', 'DVD', 'I', 'anything', 'a big screen', 'This movie', 'a real trend', 'a lot', 'real crappy B movies', 'Mel Gibson', 'this movie', ""an apologetic shrug 'classy B-grade trash"", 'it', 'his best movie', 'What', 'I', 'this film', 'its lack', 'dialogue', 'it', 'its settings', 'action', 'costumes', 'the talking', 'Gibson', 'much praise', 'it', 'he', 'a representation', 'the Western gunslinger', 'the film', 'I', 'a sketchy explanation', 'the world', 'such an apocalyptic mess', 'the viewer', 'their own conclusion', 'that end', 'It', 'The lack', 'ammunition', ""the Wez's use"", 'a wrist-strapped crossbow', 'the very preciousness', 'gasoline', ""Max's anxious mopping"", 'it', 'it', 'a few make-shift items', ""a dusty soldier's helmet"", 'The original Mad Max', 'too much dialogue', 'the 18 year old Gibson', 'the emotion', 'his family', 'best friend', 'It', 'it', 'moments', 'the end', 'it', 'it', 'impact', 'it', 'own clumsy attempt', 'the family-man Max', 'The Road Warrior', 'any deep characterizations', 'the pain', 'suffering', 'this stark world', 'a few spoken words', 'violent actions', 'George Miller', 'it', 'this one', 'he', 'Mad Max', 'Mad MaxII', 'Mad MaxIII']"
Moon|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2094631/|9|The most important issue we may face in the future is whether rapid advances in science and technology will change human beings into disposable resources, utilitarian subjects manipulated by indifferent centers of corporate power. Moon, the thought provoking and thoroughly engrossing first feature from U.K. director Duncan Jones, son of the pop singer David Bowie, tackles these questions and raises others that have been pondered since man first set foot on this planet – Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose on this planet? Though the answers do not come as easily as the questions, Moon attempts to recapture the science fiction genre from the mindless action-adventure films we have become accustomed to and brings it to a level, perhaps not seen since the classic Kubrick film 2001.Filmed on soundstages in England and set in an unspecified future time, Moon opens with a mock commercial by the Japanese corporation Lunar Industries. The Corporation has developed a technique to use the rocks on the moon to produce Helium-3, a substance that can fulfill mankind's most pressing energy needs. Their mining facility on the far side of the moon is manned only by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) and a Hal-like robot named Gerty (voice of Kevin Spacey) who communications emotions through a smiley face display while reflecting company programming. Lonely and emotionally at loose ends, Sam is nearing the end of a three-year stint and is looking forward to return home in two weeks to see his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter with whom he is only able to communicate via video recording since direct communication is temporarily out of service.When hallucinations of his lovely wife standing before him cause Sam to crash his Lunar Rover, the film takes a strange turn and never looks back. Sam wakes up in the infirmary and begins his recovery process under strict orders from Gerty not to go outside of the base. Astoundingly, Sam sees a younger version of himself who claims to have arrived to serve the same three-year contract that Sam began many years ago. Raising issues about the nature of identity and the perversion of human life by scientific and corporate power run amok, the film becomes a desperate struggle against the clock to reclaim one's humanity before a so-called rescue operation arrives to set things in order.Moon is not preachy nor does it treat the corporation as the villain incarnate. Without special effects or bombastic battle scenes, this low-budget film simply presents the possibility of what could happen if human consciousness does not keep pace with advances in genetic engineering. As such, it is brilliantly executed, fascinating and involving, and contains an outstanding double role performance by Indie star Sam Rockwell who is completely convincing as the confused and lonely astronaut who plays ping pong with himself. Director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Nathan Parker have combined the intelligence of Solaris with the chilling power of Alien to produce a work that challenges us to reconnect with our souls.|"['The most important issue', 'we', 'the future', 'rapid advances', 'science', 'technology', 'human beings', 'disposable resources', 'indifferent centers', 'corporate power', 'Moon', 'the thought', 'first feature', 'U.K. director Duncan Jones', 'son', 'the pop singer', 'David Bowie', 'these questions', 'others', 'man', 'foot', 'this planet', 'Who', 'we', 'we', 'What', 'our purpose', 'this planet', 'the answers', 'the questions', 'Moon', 'the science fiction genre', 'the mindless action-adventure films', 'we', 'it', 'a level', 'the classic Kubrick film', 'soundstages', 'England', 'an unspecified future time', 'Moon', 'a mock commercial', 'the Japanese corporation', 'Lunar Industries', 'The Corporation', 'a technique', 'the rocks', 'the moon', 'Helium-3', 'a substance', ""mankind's most pressing energy needs"", 'Their mining facility', 'the far side', 'the moon', 'Sam Bell', 'Sam Rockwell', 'a Hal-like robot', 'Gerty', 'voice', 'Kevin Spacey', 'who', 'emotions', 'a smiley face display', 'company programming', 'loose ends', 'Sam', 'the end', 'a three-year stint', 'two weeks', 'his wife', '(Dominique McElligott', 'young daughter', 'whom', 'he', 'video recording', 'direct communication', 'service', 'hallucinations', 'his lovely wife', 'him', 'Sam', 'his Lunar Rover', 'the film', 'a strange turn', 'Sam wakes', 'the infirmary', 'his recovery process', 'strict orders', 'Gerty', 'the base', 'Sam', 'a younger version', 'himself', 'who', 'the same three-year contract', 'Sam', 'issues', 'the nature', 'identity', 'the perversion', 'human life', 'scientific and corporate power', 'the film', 'a desperate struggle', 'the clock', ""one's humanity"", 'a so-called rescue operation', 'things', 'order', 'Moon', 'it', 'the corporation', 'the villain', 'special effects', 'bombastic battle scenes', 'this low-budget film', 'the possibility', 'what', 'human consciousness', 'pace', 'advances', 'genetic engineering', 'it', 'an outstanding double role performance', 'Indie star Sam Rockwell', 'who', 'the confused and lonely astronaut', 'who', 'ping pong', 'himself', 'Director Duncan Jones', 'screenwriter Nathan Parker', 'the intelligence', 'Solaris', 'the chilling power', 'Alien', 'a work', 'us', 'our souls']"
Aliens|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0229795/|10|Just recently, I have purchased the new Alien Legacy box set on DVD, and each one is excellent. Aliens is the second chapter in the Alien saga and is probably the most remembered by today's generation. Let's face it; it changed the way sci-fi movies were made forever,and it hasn't been for the best(I'm not saying Aliens is a bad film). Aliens set such a high standard in action sci-fi(basically the new genre the James Cameron has created) that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizon(both directed by Paul Anderson). They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.As for Aliens, it is a perfect sci-fi action movie. Great casting(although ALL are stereotypes), great music(James Horner is the man), great use of technology and  a well written script are all present. Weaver's performance is outstanding; one of the best action heroes of all time just happens to be a woman. If you have a chance to watch the director' cut of Aliens, I suggest you take it(it's available in the new Alien Legacy box set or alone on DVD and VHS as well as on laserdisc). It expands on Ripley's maternal persona which makes Weaver's performance all the better.James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the sci-fi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film. For all the young folk out there that have not seen this film, watch it and see perfection in action movie making. A must see.|"['I', 'the new Alien Legacy box', 'DVD', 'each one', 'Aliens', 'the second chapter', 'the Alien saga', ""today's generation"", ""'s"", 'it', 'it', 'the way', 'sci-fi movies', 'it', ""the best(I'm"", 'Aliens', 'a bad film', 'Aliens', 'such a high standard', 'action', 'sci', 'the new genre', 'the James Cameron', 'none', 'the copycats', 'the recent movies', 'Paul Anderson', 'They', 'Alien movies', 'My advice', 'Mr. Anderson', 'what', 'Enough', 'Aliens', 'it', 'a perfect sci-fi action movie', 'Great casting(although', 'stereotypes', 'great music(James Horner', 'the man', 'great use', 'technology', 'a well written script', ""Weaver's performance"", 'the best action heroes', 'all time', 'a woman', 'you', 'a chance', ""the director' cut"", 'Aliens', 'I', 'you', 'it(it', 'the new Alien Legacy box set', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'laserdisc', 'It', ""Ripley's maternal persona"", ""Weaver's performance"", 'James Cameron', 'The Terminator', 'Aliens', 'He', 'his expertise', 'the sci-fi genre', 'an engrossing story', 'the final reel', 'the film', 'all the young folk', 'this film', 'it', 'perfection', 'action movie making']"
Upgrade|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4186852/|10|This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.|['my favorite AI movie', 'date', 'I', 'it', 'low budget', 'it', 'the unknown actors', 'who', 'an excellent job', 'I', 'its lack', 'marketing', 'it', 'everyone', 'I', 'something', 'an amazing plot', 'a mind-blowing ending', 'you', 'this genre', 'you', 'this one', 'you', 'What', 'everyone', 'it', 'a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode', 'I', 'it', '10 stars', 'the simple reason', 'I', 'anything', 'it', 'anything', 'I', 'end', 'this movie', 'I', 'it']

District 9|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4245714/|10|This movie is so original and nice, that I am not going to take points off for some over the top action sequences that take a bit from its genre and concept cutting nature. Like all sci fi master-peaces, this movie poses quite a few questions, gives us new perspective, that has not been explored enough if at all. And the frightening comments about aliens are even better when you learn that they were genuine, made about the human aliens i.e. refugees. But there is much more going on. This is a must see movie and a defining movie of the 21st century sci fi genre.|['This movie', 'I', 'points', 'the top action sequences', 'a bit', 'its genre', 'concept', 'nature', 'this movie', 'quite a few questions', 'us', 'new perspective', 'the frightening comments', 'aliens', 'you', 'they', 'the human aliens', 'i.e. refugees', 'movie', 'a defining movie', 'the 21st century sci fi genre']

Donnie Darko|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1274713/|10|"""Donnie Darko"" is the very quintessence of cinema. Enigmatic, absorbing, humorous and thought-provoking - it is a film that throws up endless possibilities and debates, and ingeniously allows a whole range of interpretations that viewers might wish to pursue. There are many viewers who prefer films that provide immediate closure. In the minds of such viewers, films like ""Donnie Darko"" are unsatisfying or irritating or, worst of all, pointless. Then there are viewers who like to be challenged, perhaps even teased, by films. I would urge everyone - regardless of their usual preference - to give ""Donnie Darko"" a go. Even those who are usually dead against subjective and open-ended films of this kind will almost certainly find themselves questioning and pondering over what they have experienced. And those who revel in the mysterious, the enigmatic and the downright peculiar will absolutely LOVE this film.Troubled teenager Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on a mountain road on the morning of October 1st 1988, having either cycled there in his sleep (one interpretation), or as the result of being trapped in a month-long time loop that begins in that place and on that date (another interpretation). In the early hours of October 2nd 1988, Donnie is awakened from his sleep by a giant, grotesque bunny rabbit named Frank, who lures him away from his house to a nearby golf course and reveals to him details of the imminent end of the world. While he is out of the house, a plane engine mysteriously falls from the sky and smashes into Donnie's bedroom: bizarrely, there is no indication of where the engine fell from as no plane lost its engine in that area on that night. Having apparently cheated death as a result of his hallucinatory relationship with Frank, Donnie spends the rest of the month experiencing incredible, and often disturbing, events as time ticks inexorably towards Frank's terrifying deadline. Guided by Frank, he carries out irrational actions - such as burning down the residence of behavioural guru Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Each time, Donnie's actions - however mad or misguided they may seem - lead to worthwhile consequences (e.g Cunningham's house turns out to be the site of a child porn ring, which is uncovered when firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze started by Donnie). It eventually transpires that Donnie is living in a tangent universe which began on the night he evaded death in the plane engine accident., and only Donnie can set straight this potentially catastrophic time corruption.... even though it will mean sacrificing himself in the original October 2nd accident.""Donnie Darko"" is a superb film on so many levels. Richard Kelly directs the film with an incredible eye for striking detail and his script is full of quotable dialogue and inventive, philosophical ideas. The narrative, which seems initially confusing, is proved by repeat viewings of the film to be extremely clever. Even if repeat viewings never fully clear the confusion, the ingenuity of the story comes from the fact that it invites and supports several different readings of what the film is really all about. Nothing is made explicit, everything is left open, and for that reason the film remains a fascinating experience regardless of how often one re-watches it. The music and photography (by Michael Andrews and Steven Poster respectively) are brilliantly atmospheric and add yet more to the film's incredible bag of goodies. ""Donnie Darko"" is quite literally life-changing - a film like no other, and one of the very best movies of all-time."|"['Donnie Darko', 'the very quintessence', 'cinema', 'it', 'a film', 'endless possibilities', 'debates', 'a whole range', 'interpretations', 'viewers', 'many viewers', 'who', 'films', 'immediate closure', 'the minds', 'such viewers', 'films', 'Donnie Darko', 'viewers', 'who', 'films', 'I', 'everyone', 'their usual preference', 'Donnie Darko', 'a go', 'who', 'subjective and open-ended films', 'this kind', 'themselves', 'what', 'they', 'who', 'the mysterious', 'this film', 'Troubled teenager Donnie Darko', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'a mountain road', 'the morning', 'October 1st', 'his sleep', '(one interpretation', 'the result', 'a month-long time loop', 'that place', 'that date', '(another interpretation', 'the early hours', 'October 2nd', 'Donnie', 'his sleep', 'a giant', 'grotesque bunny rabbit', 'Frank', 'who', 'him', 'his house', 'a nearby golf course', 'him', 'details', 'the imminent end', 'the world', 'he', 'the house', 'a plane engine', 'the sky', ""Donnie's bedroom"", 'no indication', 'the engine', 'no plane', 'its engine', 'that area', 'that night', 'death', 'a result', 'his hallucinatory relationship', 'Frank', 'Donnie', 'the rest', 'the month', 'time', ""Frank's terrifying deadline"", 'Frank', 'he', 'irrational actions', 'the residence', 'behavioural guru', 'Jim Cunningham', 'Patrick Swayze', ""Donnie's actions"", 'they', 'worthwhile consequences', ""e.g Cunningham's house"", 'the site', 'a child porn ring', 'firefighters', 'the blaze', 'Donnie', 'It', 'Donnie', 'a tangent universe', 'the night', 'he', 'death', 'the plane engine accident', 'only Donnie', 'straight this potentially catastrophic time corruption', 'it', 'himself', 'the original October 2nd accident', 'Darko', 'a superb film', 'so many levels', 'Richard Kelly', 'the film', 'an incredible eye', 'striking detail', 'his script', 'quotable dialogue', 'inventive, philosophical ideas', 'The narrative', 'repeat viewings', 'the film', 'viewings', 'the confusion', 'the ingenuity', 'the story', 'the fact', 'it', 'several different readings', 'what', 'the film', 'Nothing', 'everything', 'that reason', 'the film', 'a fascinating experience', 'how often one re', '-', 'it', 'The music', 'photography', 'Michael Andrews', 'Steven Poster', ""the film's incredible bag"", 'goodies', 'Donnie Darko', 'a film', 'the very best movies', 'all-time']"
The Cabin in the Woods|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2596227/|1|I must admit, the trailers tempt you to go watch this flick and they do a pretty darn good job of attracting people and raise curiosity. But my question to the writer and director of this movie is guys, what have you been smokin? The movie definitely kicks off with a great start and develops the momentum but rapidly breaks it apart. Who set these people up? What's the reason for the profiles? Who runs these operations? Who watches the show? What is at stake (as the lab scientist mentions)? The motive? I get it, these guys are in horror business but they could have made it an interesting concept by following it through. All you see is series of deaths and the most weirdest climax you could imagine. Even at last, the lead heroine and her friend are able to survive thousands of most terrible creatures and find their way to ritual place. There is no law, no police, no backup plans (considering they are running such a scary business). Just like the cabin is a setup, I think the hype and the publicity and the high ratings may be a setup too to pull the audience. Do me a favor, save few bucks..not only what you are gonna spend on the movie but also what you are going to lose for your time going to this useless flick.|['I', 'the trailers', 'you', 'this flick', 'they', 'a pretty darn good job', 'people', 'curiosity', 'my question', 'the writer', 'director', 'this movie', 'guys', 'what', 'you', 'The movie', 'a great start', 'the momentum', 'it', 'Who', 'these people', 'What', 'the reason', 'the profiles', 'Who', 'these operations', 'Who', 'the show', 'What', 'stake', 'the lab scientist', 'The motive', 'I', 'it', 'these guys', 'horror business', 'they', 'it', 'it', 'you', 'series', 'deaths', 'the most weirdest climax', 'you', 'the lead heroine', 'her friend', 'thousands', 'most terrible creatures', 'their way', 'ritual place', 'no law', 'no police', 'no backup plans', 'they', 'such a scary business', 'the cabin', 'a setup', 'I', 'the hype', 'the publicity', 'the high ratings', 'a setup', 'the audience', 'me', 'a favor', 'few bucks', 'what', 'you', 'the movie', 'what', 'you', 'your time', 'this useless flick']
Interstellar|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3117671/|10|(((WOW)))...!!!It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ?

Unbreakable|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0686101/|0|This movie will be the curious nugget in the collection of Shyamalan films. It is great to see young writing and directing talent that is carving a niche away from the usual fair while running with the big boys and girls. Entering the mainstream was achieved through his kick-off blockbuster, The Sixth Sense. If you are among the small cadre of people who figured out The Sixth Sense's twist before the ending, salute! Unbreakable continues Shyamalan's unorthodox view of things by crafting a more 'mortal' superhero drama. Unlike Peter Parker (Toby Maguire - Spiderman) who completely emerges as Spiderman (web-slinging and building-hopping) within about 30 minutes of the whole movie, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is discovering his more subtle but extraordinary abilities for the whole movie, with some help from his friends and foes. Being able to stick to and vertically climb a building wall is a fairly noticeable attribute (why it would occur to somebody to try it escapes me) but never being sick in one's life may actually escape one's attention. People develop mindsets that prevent them from recognizing certain things until a suggestion changes that condition. In this movie, being the sole (uninjured) survivor of a train crash is a pretty strong suggestion. From there you watch the revelation unfold. Yes, there is a villain but I won't spoil the movie for those who have not ventured to try it.

Primer|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2843002/|1|Before I get into it, let me cut to the chase for those of you too impatient to read my entire review: I do not recommend this movie even slightly. Imagine watching some grainy, washed-out, poorly-shot home video with bad audio and boring annoying people you know nothing about doing random stuff you have little context for. That's what watching this movie is like.I was all set to love this movie. A deep intricate plot based on time travel... How could they go wrong? Well, they found a way...From the beginning the movie is hard to follow and boring; The main characters go about their lives as normal engineers or businessmen or something, rambling endlessly about boring stuff. I could not follow what they were talking about, or whether I'm even supposed to be able to follow. I'm no dummy, I'm a professional engineer myself but I found it very frustrating. The movie is alienating to viewers from the beginning.Then when the plot picks up and gets into the time travel stuff, the viewer's experience still suffers because nothing is really explained clearly. I watched the whole movie and left confused about the basics as to how the time travel machine was even supposed to work.The characters are boring and joyless. They have an effin' time machine and not once do they seem excited or happy about it. Despite their grave attitude, that doesn't stop them from making painful-to-watch, unnecessarily, bad and reckless decisions about using time travel. It's like the worst of both worlds of serious vs. not-serious.The makers of this movie should have spent less time making the movie complex and more time making it actually *watchable*. The plot quickly devolves into an unnecessarily vague and confusing mess. The only reason I have any clue what happened was because I found a college essay about it that lays the plot out. Even after reading about it, I'm not impressed by the plot. It's just complex just for the sake of being complex and beyond that, no creativity or artistry whatsoever. The writers of this movie seem to have no sense of art or aesthetics, or what would be engaging or enjoyable to a human being.In many scenes I gritted my teeth straining to hear what the heck the actors are actually saying. At the same time I fumed wondering how they could put all this time and effort to make a movie, and yet it didn't occur to them that having rumbling engines or rushing water drowning out the dialogue might be something that has to be corrected before releasing a movie.What else can I say? Terrible movie... for your own sanity, stay away.|"['I', 'it', 'me', 'the chase', 'you', 'my entire review', 'I', 'this movie', 'some grainy', ', washed-out, poorly-shot home video', 'bad audio and boring annoying people', 'you', 'nothing', 'random stuff', 'you', 'little context', 'what', 'this movie', 'I', 'this movie', 'A deep intricate plot', 'time travel', 'they', 'they', 'a way', 'the beginning', 'the movie', 'The main characters', 'their lives', 'normal engineers', 'businessmen', 'something', 'boring stuff', 'I', 'what', 'they', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'a professional engineer', 'I', 'it', 'The movie', 'viewers', 'the beginning', 'the plot', 'the time travel stuff', ""the viewer's experience"", 'nothing', 'I', 'the whole movie', 'the basics', 'the time travel machine', 'The characters', 'They', ""an effin' time machine"", 'they', 'it', 'their grave attitude', 'them', 'decisions', 'time travel', 'It', 'both worlds', 'The makers', 'this movie', 'less time', 'the movie complex', 'more time', 'it', 'The plot', 'an unnecessarily vague and confusing mess', 'The only reason', 'I', 'any clue', 'what', 'I', 'a college essay', 'it', 'the plot', 'it', 'I', 'the plot', 'It', 'the sake', 'no creativity', 'artistry', 'The writers', 'this movie', 'no sense', 'art', 'aesthetics', 'what', 'a human being', 'many scenes', 'I', 'my teeth', 'what', 'the actors', 'the same time', 'I', 'they', 'a movie', 'it', 'them', 'engines', 'water', 'the dialogue', 'something', 'a movie', 'What', 'I', 'Terrible movie', 'your own sanity']"
They Live|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5713393/|8|"Ever wonder why people line up in droves to follow the latest fad? What causes us to scurry about like ants, or conform like willing slaves? Why do we obey and consume like mindless drones? The answer is right here in THEY LIVE.Director John Carpenter strips off the facade, and shows us the ugly truth. A secret invasion force has crept in and assumed control, having inserted themselves among us as we marched blindly along. Now, posing as ""normal"" human beings, these impostors hold positions at the highest levels of government! This certainly explains the synthetic nature of politics, doesn't it?Now, subliminal messages hidden in the constant din of commercials have hypnotized us into walking trances, and made us easy prey. We are finished!THEY are everywhere! THEY are our true masters!This movie captures both the paranoia and dark humor of a society tamed and controlled by alien overlords, without even knowing it.

The Martian|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3333894/|5|The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue? A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist).Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we. The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story.In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in!

10 Cloverfield Lane|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3429021/|9|"Two months ago, no one knew that 10 Cloverfield existed, let alone was about to be wide released in theaters. One month ago, no one had any idea how, if at all, this film was related to the 2008 film Cloverfield except for the obvious title and produced J.J. Abrams. And now, all is revealed. Sort of. Here's my review.One of the greatest things 10 Cloverfield Lane has to offer is that the audience really has no idea what to expect going into the film. Very much in the J.J Abrams way, the production for this film has been left completely under-wraps and the trailers have revealed next to nothing. That's one of the benefits for the movies, so I'm not going to spoil or give anything away in my synopsis or the review. I won't even tell you if this movie is indeed a Cloverfield sequel or if it's something different altogether. You'll have to find out for yourself, because I can tell you right now that you should spend the money to go see it in theaters.I'll be brief. A woman we know very little about named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car crash in a breath taking opening credit sequence. She wakes up a few days later to find herself in an underground bunker with Howard (John Goodman), a large and crazed eyed farmer standing above her. He tells her that she can't leave, because some sort of disaster has happened and it's not safe to go outside. Finding herself alone with Howard and another man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), and I'm stealing their tag line here because it's a dang good tag line, they find out that Monsters come in many forms.Obviously I had no idea to expect when I went into 10 Cloverfield Lane. No one did. But within the first five minutes they set the tone so you know what kind of movie they are going for, and I found myself instantly engaged. For the rest of the film, I was floored with what was going on. Director Dan Trachtenberg takes the reigns on creating a film that will hit you with the unexpected, and leave your jaw hanging.The best word I could think of to describe this film while I was watching it was claustrophobic. For the scenes that takes place in the bunker (I'm not saying how much of the screen time that actually is) they create such an intense and nervous atmosphere that you feel yourself getting antsy along with the characters. That's because for almost the whole film, we don't really know what's going on. We know what John Goodman is telling us and leading us to believe, but we have no idea if that's reliable or not. We discover things along with the characters, which is why this film is such a good build up. When the conclusion to the film finally comes, you leave more than satisfied. But don't ruin it for yourself by looking up online spoilers to see if it is a Cloverfield sequel. Spend the money. See the movie. Find out for yourself. It's worth it.I've heard the argument and I've sited it a few times in past reviews, that the best way to bring out great performances in actors is to lock them in a single setting film where they having nothing to hide their performance behind. That's what happens here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actress who deserves to get more work than she does, played the character so well as she captures the nervous ticks without acting completely helpless the whole time. In the end, she was pretty bad-ass. John Gallagher Jr., a character who could have been super annoying, ended up being great in the film too, and had really good chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead.But the stand-out of the film if John Goodman. John Goodman is in so many films every year that we sometimes take him for granted and forget how good of an actor he can be when he's not mailing it in (whatever Hangover film he was in. I forget) but rather commits whole heartedly to a role. That's what happens here. He could have easily over-cooked his performance where it came of as cartoon-y or unrealistic, but he hit just the right level of disturbing and off-putting where you are crept out by the guy but you can't be sure if he's in the right or wrong. It's a performance similar to Joel Edgerton's in The Gift.ALSO just read on IMDb that Bradely Cooper's voice appeared over a cell-phone in one scene. I knew I had heard the voice somewhere but I couldn't put my finger on it until now.At no point of 10 Cloverfield Lane does the film slow down or lose interest. It uses it's hour and forty five minute runtime, a surprisingly long one for this type of film, to achieve the best possible effects. The film flies by and I found myself never wanting it to be over. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie you should rush out to the theater to go see. Accept that you know nothing about it going in, and enjoy that experience. Because it's something that doesn't happen often and it's a rare gift when it does. 10 Cloverfield Lane has a lot to offer despite the fact that it's a very small film. In fact, regardless of the fact if they are in the same universe, I'll say I enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane more than I enjoyed Cloverfield itself. And I want to see the story continued in a sequel. 10 Cloverfield Lane gets an A-, it's one of my favorite films of 2016 so far. Go see it this weekend.

Dredd|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2670168/|0|"Having feverishly waited in anticipation (skulking around IMDb, snapping at each morsel with fanboy delight) it was a joy to finally sit down in the auditorium; with Judge Dredd badge pinned humorously to my DK 'Bedtime For Democracy' T-shirt (chortle).The film starts with some spoken exposition, although where there was once James Earl Jones, we now have Urban. Establishing scenes of chaos evoke familiarity, as Mega-City One channels more current, turbulent times. Herein we are thrust into the Iron Lawman's world, and he wastes no time in dispensing justice most radical. Olivia Thirlby is introduced as Anderson, the rookie assigned to Dredd for assessment. She is played as Dredd's emotive foil (much like the comics). Whereas in '95, William Wisher moaned that "" if I couldn't care about him (Dredd), how could I hope to convince anyone else to?""--Bunk line of thinking, creep!--here we circumnavigate that with Anderson's character arc. Dredd is a hard-assed, business-as-usual guy, with the voice to match. Only rarely did his dialogue verge on the gorgonzola.The film is an unashamed, stripped back actioner with cinematography and music elevating it far above genre requirements. Think 'Drive', with the electronic score and city shots, but scorched of gloss. DREDD is tough and that's reflected in the architecture, the uniform, and the hardware. The judges rightfully look intimidating and brutal, and the closer-quartered combat, I felt, emphasised this. I also enjoyed the wacky array of citizens, a killer 2000AD touch.I've ran right of steam now, but overall, great film and look forward to watching it again. The film is a straight up 8, but warrants an IMDb 10 out of principle."|"['anticipation', 'IMDb', 'each morsel', 'fanboy delight', 'it', 'a joy', 'the auditorium', 'Judge Dredd badge', ""my DK 'Bedtime"", 'Democracy', 'T-shirt', 'chortle).The film', 'some spoken exposition', 'James Earl Jones', 'we', 'Urban', 'scenes', 'chaos evoke familiarity', '-', 'City', 'we', ""the Iron Lawman's world"", 'he', 'no time', 'dispensing justice', 'Olivia Thirlby', 'Anderson', 'the rookie', 'Dredd', 'assessment', 'She', ""Dredd's emotive foil"", 'the comics', 'William Wisher', 'I', 'him', 'I', 'anyone', 'to?""--Bunk line', 'thinking', 'we', ""Anderson's character arc"", 'Dredd', 'a hard-assed, business-as-usual guy', 'the voice', 'his dialogue', 'the gorgonzola', 'The film', 'actioner', 'cinematography', 'music', 'it', 'genre requirements', 'Drive', 'the electronic score', 'city shots', 'gloss', 'DREDD', 'the architecture', 'the uniform', 'the hardware', 'The judges', 'the closer-quartered combat', 'I', 'I', 'the wacky array', 'citizens', 'a killer 2000AD touch', 'steam', 'overall, great film', 'it', 'The film', 'a straight', 'an IMDb', 'principle']"
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0980979/|10|Here's the basic plot. Clemintine and Joel have a long, rocky relationship. Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure. Now here's what I thought about it. This movie is completely amazing. Totally original story and wonderful directing. Some of the best directing that i've seen in any movie. Some of the best original music too. This is in my top five favorites, and it also boosted Jim Carrey into one of my favorite actors. You know you have a good movie on your hands when the next day you're still thinking about parts of it, and you want to see those parts again. If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you check it out. It's different, in a really good way. There's not much more to tell you about it. If you want to see the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey, than you should absolutely skip this one. But if you want to see a side of him and Kate Winslet that you've never seen, or if you want to see a total original movie with wonderful cinematography and really great music, then by all means, you should absolutely see this one!|['the basic plot', 'Joel', 'a long, rocky relationship', 'Clemintine', 'Joel', 'her memory', 'Joel', 'Joel', 'the process', 'the erasing', 'he', 'the really sweet, nice memories', 'he', 'the procedure', 'what', 'I', 'it', 'This movie', 'Totally original story', 'wonderful directing', 'the best directing', 'i', 'any movie', 'the best original music', 'my top five favorites', 'it', 'Jim Carrey', 'my favorite actors', 'You', 'you', 'a good movie', 'your hands', 'you', 'parts', 'it', 'you', 'those parts', 'you', 'I', 'you', 'it', 'It', 'a really good way', 'you', 'it', 'you', 'the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey', 'you', 'this one', 'you', 'a side', 'him', 'Kate Winslet', 'you', 'you', 'a total original movie', 'wonderful cinematography', 'really great music', 'all means', 'you', 'this one']

A Clockwork Orange|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0115800/|10|"To say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad. He's not just unlikable; he's despicable, terrifying, sick, twisted, and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. But Alex does not see himself as a sick person. The key to this is in his voice-over narrative.Alex does not see himself as a pervert, just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism. To us, we are all normal, which is a scary thought.""A Clockwork Orange,"" which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating (that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture), had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years. Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious.But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy (or squirm through) ""A Clockwork Orange"" in its entire odd splendor, it is an experience you are likely to never forget. Its characters, its style, its subject matter, its explicit material--all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling.Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is indeed as offbeat as its title.All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate, or like, or--at the very least--learn to tolerate. Not ""A Clockwork Orange."" Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie, always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world. He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning.

Children of Men|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1567307/|0|"I finished the year is despair, because though I've seen many good films this year, I've seen very few actually released in 2006. What a surprise to discover some late in the game.This is one, and it really surprised me. That's because though I generally regard Hispanic filmmakers as the vanguard, he hasn't really impressed  not as a major talent. My how he impresses now. This isn't just an effective film, its effective in ways that show he really understands some of the theoretical mechanics.Here's what I mean. I was greatly impressed by the opening scene of ""Casino Royale."" But if you look at it closely, you'll see that someone could have produced it by mere extrapolation. All they have to do is look at examples of things that are exciting in current movies and do the same, except a little more intensively.But what Cuaron has done is go back to first principles. He knows how Welles redefined space. He knows how Tarkovsky created a whole new sort of eye by making the camera drift. He knows how Kirosawa invented the notion of layered planes. He's synthesized these in a new way, it seems to me. It isn't radical enough to not be readily digestible to a modern film-goer. But it also isn't much like what we had before, which I may typify with Ridly Scott's ""Blackhawk Down."" There's a scene toward the end which I imagine was where he started to imagine this project. Our escaping couple are detailed on the street by those who have been chasing them. This group is ambiguously evil, perhaps even the good guys. They prepare to kill Owen's character and perhaps do. From that point until near the end that seems to be one continuous shot. It isn't, but it seems to be, ""Rope"" -like.He runs down the street and around a corner, being shot at. He runs into a bus and out. Then across the street in the middle of heavy combat where a building is under attack. All this is hand-held using a partially-stabilized camera, halfway between a documentarian's camera (at this point blood is spattered on the lens), and the other way toward stylized distance that surveys the planes of the spaces while they are animated with bullet hits.We then follow him into the building, up several flights and down hallways to retrieve his ""family,"" then on out again. At this point he becomes ""seen"" by those around him. Before, he was more like us, there but disembodied, in a die hard sense. Now he becomes part of the texture and we later discover, wounded.So on down and out of the building to be adored, as Joseph the partner of the Maddona and then a tank explodes and we are back into the space, leading to a tunnel, an expanse of water, and then something else.Its so wonderfully choreographed, the camera, the narrator's stance, the dancing walls, the object that appear and vaporize, the shifting types of engagement among us, characters and place...We know we are being set up. This is no Terry Gilliam who basically intuits. Before this scene we see all the bits from the other masters presented separately. The Tarkovsky bits were perhaps less meditative that I would have liked. One was a visit to an abandoned school where we see our mother outside through a hole in the window, and encounters happen that ""break emotional walls."" The other is the presence of a profoundly senile old woman, and how she is included.You walk through other basic film vocabularies elsewhere until they all combine in this last sequence. A Kurosawa episode on a bus when the midwife is taken to meet her fate.Quite apart from the visual vocabulary, he's done well with complementary notions of story. Its science fiction but without tedious explanations. The world just is. There's brutality as in the future of ""Vendetta,"" but one can see it isn't religious wars or jingoism that fuels it, but a far deeper existential concern. Julianne's character is the grand motivator, though wonderfully (in terms of story mechanics) she disappears early, effectively launching the real story: our hero is a storymaker.Noir. Regular readers know I define noir a bit different than ordinarily. It has to do with ordinary folks thrust into extraordinary situations as if the existence of the viewer motivates a capricious fate that weaves and frames a story for our eye. What we have here is ambiguous noir, and the first real action noir. Quite an achievement. Quite an experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."|"['I', 'the year', 'despair', 'I', 'many good films', 'I', 'What a surprise', 'the game', 'it', 'me', 'I', 'Hispanic filmmakers', 'the vanguard', 'he', '\x97', 'a major talent', 'he', 'just an effective film', 'ways', 'he', 'the theoretical mechanics', 'what', 'I', 'I', 'the opening scene', '""Casino Royale', 'you', 'it', 'you', 'someone', 'it', 'mere extrapolation', 'they', 'examples', 'things', 'current movies', 'what', 'Cuaron', 'first principles', 'He', 'Welles', 'space', 'He', 'Tarkovsky', 'a whole new sort', 'eye', 'the camera drift', 'He', 'Kirosawa', 'the notion', 'layered planes', 'He', 'a new way', 'it', 'me', 'It', 'a modern film-goer', 'it', 'what', 'we', 'I', 'Ridly Scott\'s ""Blackhawk', 'a scene', 'the end', 'I', 'he', 'this project', 'Our escaping couple', 'the street', 'who', 'them', 'This group', 'They', ""Owen's character"", 'that point', 'the end', 'one continuous shot', 'It', 'it', 'Rope', 'He', 'the street', 'a corner', 'He', 'a bus', 'the street', 'the middle', 'heavy combat', 'a building', 'attack', 'a partially-stabilized camera', ""a documentarian's camera"", 'this point', 'blood', 'the lens', 'the other way', 'stylized distance', 'the planes', 'the spaces', 'they', 'bullet hits', 'We', 'him', 'the building', 'several flights', 'hallways', 'his ""family', 'this point', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'us', 'a die hard sense', 'he', 'part', 'the texture', 'we', 'the building', 'Joseph', 'the Maddona', 'then a tank explodes', 'we', 'the space', 'a tunnel', 'an expanse', 'water', 'then something', 'engagement', 'us', 'characters', 'place', 'We', 'we', 'no Terry Gilliam', 'who', 'this scene', 'we', 'all the bits', 'the other masters', 'The Tarkovsky bits', 'I', 'a visit', 'an abandoned school', 'we', 'our mother', 'a hole', 'the window', 'encounters', 'emotional walls', 'the presence', 'a profoundly senile old woman', 'she', 'You', 'other basic film vocabularies', 'they', 'this last sequence', 'A Kurosawa episode', 'a bus', 'the midwife', 'her fate', 'the visual vocabulary', 'he', 'complementary notions', 'story', 'Its science fiction', 'tedious explanations', 'The world', 'brutality', 'the future', '""Vendetta', 'one', 'it', 'religious wars', 'jingoism', 'it', 'a far deeper existential concern', ""Julianne's character"", 'the grand motivator', 'terms', 'story mechanics', 'she', 'the real story', 'our hero', 'a storymaker', 'Noir', 'Regular readers', 'I', 'noir', 'It', 'ordinary folks', 'extraordinary situations', 'the existence', 'the viewer', 'a capricious fate', 'a story', 'our eye', 'What', 'we', 'ambiguous noir', 'the first real action noir', 'Quite an achievement', 'Quite an experience', ""Ted's Evaluation"", 'Worth']"

Rise of the Planet of the Apes|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2470482/|8|"Summer 2011 will go down in history as one of the more disappointing seasons in many years when it comes to movies. This is the time of year that people rush out in masses to see the latest action extravaganza, and to be fair, some films have delivered on that promise -- ""Harry Potter,"" ""Captain America"" (though I have yet to see either of them and am simply relying on general reactions) -- but there's been a whole lot of disappointments, too, and the worst part is that people still seem to be flocking to them, almost out of necessity than wont (""Transformers 3"" and ""Pirates 4"" both made over $1 bil worldwide, which is amazing, because they both sucked).I think the last film anyone expected to reverse the trend this summer was a prequel to a franchise that has been consistently poor over the years since its original incarnation in 1968. Indeed, the first trailer for ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focused on ape carnage and mayhem, and although a subsequent one highlighted the dramatic underpinning of the film, it seemed like Fox was just trying to turn around its marketing and fool people into thinking there was more than meets the eye.Alas, the second trailer turned out to be a far more accurate reflection of the movie than anyone would have expected. ""Rise of the Apes"" is most likely the best film of the blockbuster season, full of heart, carefully crafted and professionally delivered on every level.Sure, the story has its fair share of clichés -- the ""evil caretakers"" played by Brian Cox and Tom Felton seem bad just because the film requires them to be, and Felton's performance in particular is so over-the-top that it's almost a caricature -- but because of how the film is packaged, and because it spends so much time focusing on the character of Caesar (played magnificently by Andy Serkis), you are willing to overlook many of the flaws. You care about the characters and the story, even when you kinda know where it's headed and feel like it's a variation of a prison break-out movie with apes in place of humans.The human cast, as has been noted by many critics, is nothing to write home about. James Franco doesn't exactly phone in his performance but it's not the sort of role that is going to be lining him up for any awards. Toby Maguire was originally lined up for the project before he was dropped (he reportedly came to Fox with script notes, and they promptly cut off discussions with him), but Franco does seem a more natural fit, and does well enough in a role destined to be sidelined by the apes.And the apes are awesome. No, we haven't quite mastered fully realistic CGI yet -- especially when it's mixed with live actors. (WETA claims that the technology here is superior to ""Avatar,"" but it's not as convincing, perhaps because the CGI so rarely interacted with human actors in ""Avatar,"" and thus we were able to accept the fantasy world more willingly.) However, this is some of the best seen to date. Serkis (who previously played King Kong in Peter Jackson's remake) translates a brilliant performance, for which the film owes a great deal; Caesar is really the crux of the whole thing, and a poor or less realistic performance would have undermined the whole thing. It's the subtle stuff here that makes a difference -- the emotions captured in Caesar's facial expressions, or the glint of sympathy in his eyes when John Lithgow's character begins to suffer from Alzheimer's. There's a moment of genius in that particular scene where Caesar exchanges a sad, knowing glance with Franco's character, and it's eerily touching.Director Rupert Wyatt follows blockbuster blueprints from beginning to end, but by enriching the first three-quarters of his film with character development and an actual *story* (something so many blockbusters these days seem to be sorely lacking), when the big action sequence arrives at the end, you're invested in what's happening -- and you actually care.I confess to never having watched many of the ""Apes"" films. I do recall seeing the Tim Burton remake in theaters a decade ago, and even as a 12-year-old kid, I thought, Wow, this sucks. ""Rise"" is infinitely better, more creative and more emotionally stirring -- as aforementioned, it's nothing completely unique or novel from a storytelling standpoint, but it's well-crafted in an old-fashioned, refreshingly familiar way, and the addition of groundbreaking CGI makes it a ""must-see"" rather than something to catch on television. Fox isn't known for pleasing fans with their remakes and sequels (whether it be Die Hard or Wolverine), but Summer 2011 sees two of their biggest properties successfully reinvigorated: first ""X-Men First Class,"" and now this. For my money, ""Apes"" is better -- perhaps the best blockbuster of the season -- which I never in a million years expected to say.Without spoiling anything, the film sets itself up for a sequel. Considering it's on track to smash expectations and take in $55 mil this weekend alone, it's pretty much a sure-thing that it will happen. Hopefully the follow-up takes heed of this film's strengths and doesn't abandon the character development in favor of boisterous action sequences. The fact that audiences are reacting strongly to this movie is an indication of what's been lacking all summer: stories with characters we care about. Go see this if you want to end a disappointing summer on a positive note."|"['Summer', 'history', 'the more disappointing seasons', 'many years', 'it', 'movies', 'the time', 'year', 'people', 'masses', 'the latest action extravaganza', 'some films', 'that promise', '""Harry Potter', 'Captain America', 'I', 'them', 'general reactions', 'a whole lot', 'disappointments', 'the worst part', 'people', 'them', 'necessity', 'than wont (""Transformers', '""Pirates', 'over $1 bil', 'they', 'both sucked).I', 'the last film', 'anyone', 'the trend', 'a prequel', 'a franchise', 'the years', 'its original incarnation', 'the first trailer', '""Rise', 'the Planet', 'the Apes', 'ape carnage', 'mayhem', 'a subsequent one', 'the dramatic underpinning', 'the film', 'it', 'Fox', 'its marketing', 'fool', 'people', 'the eye', 'the second trailer', 'a far more accurate reflection', 'the movie', 'anyone', 'Rise', 'the Apes', 'the best film', 'the blockbuster season', 'heart', 'every level', 'the story', 'its fair share', 'clichés', 'the ""evil caretakers', 'Brian Cox', 'Tom Felton', 'the film', 'them', ""Felton's performance"", 'the-top', 'it', 'a caricature', 'the film', 'it', 'so much time', 'the character', 'Caesar', 'Andy Serkis', 'you', 'the flaws', 'You', 'the characters', 'the story', 'you', 'it', 'it', 'a variation', 'a prison break-out movie', 'apes', 'place', 'humans', 'The human cast', 'many critics', 'nothing', 'home', 'James Franco', 'his performance', 'it', 'the sort', 'role', 'him', 'any awards', 'Toby Maguire', 'the project', 'he', 'he', 'Fox', 'script notes', 'they', 'discussions', 'him', 'Franco', 'a more natural fit', 'a role', 'the apes', 'the apes', 'we', 'fully realistic CGI', 'it', 'live actors', 'WETA', 'the technology', 'Avatar', 'it', 'human actors', 'Avatar', 'we', 'the fantasy world', 'date', 'Serkis', 'who', 'King Kong', ""Peter Jackson's remake"", 'a brilliant performance', 'the film', 'a great deal', 'Caesar', 'the crux', 'the whole thing', 'a poor or less realistic performance', 'the whole thing', 'It', 'the subtle stuff', 'a difference', 'the emotions', ""Caesar's facial expressions"", 'the glint', 'sympathy', 'his eyes', ""John Lithgow's character"", 'Alzheimer', 'a moment', 'genius', 'that particular scene', 'Caesar', 'glance', ""Franco's character"", 'it', 'Director Rupert Wyatt', 'blockbuster blueprints', 'end', 'the first three-quarters', 'his film', 'character development', 'an actual *story', '(something so many blockbusters', 'the big action sequence', 'the end', 'you', 'what', 'you', 'I', 'the ""Apes"" films', 'I', 'the Tim Burton remake', 'theaters', 'a 12-year-old kid', 'I', '""Rise', 'it', 'nothing', 'a storytelling standpoint', 'it', 'an old-fashioned, refreshingly familiar way', 'the addition', 'groundbreaking', 'CGI', 'it', 'something', 'television', 'Fox', 'fans', 'their remakes', 'sequels', 'it', 'Summer', 'their biggest properties', ': first ""X-Men First Class', 'my money', 'Apes', 'perhaps the best blockbuster', 'the season', 'a million years', 'anything', 'the film', 'itself', 'a sequel', 'it', 'track', 'expectations', '$55 mil', 'it', 'a sure-thing', 'it', 'the follow-up', 'heed', ""this film's strengths"", 'the character development', 'favor', 'boisterous action sequences', 'The fact', 'audiences', 'this movie', 'an indication', 'what', 'stories', 'characters', 'we', 'you', 'a disappointing summer', 'a positive note']"

The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.

Sunshine|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2289808/|0|50 years from now, a crew of eight astronauts are heading to our dying sun via the colossal Icarus II spaceship. Having left earth frozen in a solar winter, they are humanity's last hope after the failure of the original Icarus mission several years earlier. They are to drop a massive nuclear bomb into the heart of the sun, hopefully reigniting the fading star. All of earth's remaining resources were mined to create the bomb, so there won't be another shot. Unfortunately, minds tend to crack under the most unbearable pressure one could ever imagine.A brilliant film. I will always remember August 8th, 2007 as the day when I first saw Sunshine. A most memorable date indeed, as I saw what would become second only to Requiem for a Dream on my list of all-time favorite films. Due to the dim bulbs at Fox, I had to drive all the way to North Richland Hills to see it, but never has going out of my way to see a film been more worth the effort.Danny Boyle's science fiction epic is pure, unadulterated tension. I actually became physically uncomfortable (sweating, tingling, the works) due to the tension and claustrophobia on display. Not only your typical claustrophobia, but claustrophobia of the mind as well. I felt every bit of psychosis, loneliness and pressure that the characters felt. To be that far from home for such a long time, all cramped up in a ship headed for the searing heat of the sun... I felt that. I rarely feel this way for film characters, but here, I felt the depth and the seriousness of their situation. I felt sucker punched every time one of them died. The demise of Kaneda was especially effective. The raw, emotional reactions from the actors sold it to me big time. It's sort of hard to explain, but Sunshine just hammered me in a way that more traditionally disturbing films aren't capable of. This film nails the horrors of psychological exhaustion as flawlessly as any film I've seen.It helps that the cast was uniformly excellent. Each character had their own unique voice and their own unique reaction to the situation at hand. Of the lot, Chris Evans really impressed me as Mace. I didn't think he was much of an actor before seeing him in this film. Special mention to my favorite actress, Rose Byrne. Her performances never disappoint, her charm is unmatched and she possesses a beauty more intense than the sun itself.I have no complaints about the third act. None. I will agree with general consensus that Alex Garland usually goes off the rails towards the end of his screenplays, but not here. It was clearly being built up to all throughout the film. Just look at the spiritual awakening that the sun inspires in Searle, or the first video message we see from Pinbacker. And yes, spirituality is used to fascinating effect, adding a deep layer of personal poignancy to the film. One of the key themes of Sunshine, after all, is man's relationship with the sun itself, the source of all life. It also allowed for the creepy aspect of Pinbacker posing the bodies of his victims.Unlike many people, I actually loved the filming technique used to shoot Pinbacker. It reminded me of the visible heat waves one often sees rising off of highway asphalt. The introduction of Pinbacker in the observation room, by the way, is a classic scene. Absolutely classic.This film was the one to push me into the whole HD/Blu-Ray thing. I had virtually no desire to upgrade formats, but this film was so astonishingly visual, it single-handedly opened me to the idea. I don't know if I've ever seen more beautifully realized visuals than those captured here. Couple that with the booming sound design and I'm so relieved that I managed to catch this theatrically. It was such an experience, and I'd like to replicate that experience as closely as possible with each future viewing.Sunshine is a stunning film that I could discuss endlessly. Fox really dropped the ball with promotion and distribution. It deserved so much better in that regard, but what's done is done. Now, if only the film's equally incredible soundtrack would hit CD in the near future.|"['a crew', 'eight astronauts', 'our dying sun', 'the colossal Icarus II spaceship', 'earth', 'a solar winter', 'they', ""humanity's last hope"", 'the failure', 'the original Icarus mission', 'They', 'a massive nuclear bomb', 'the heart', 'the sun', 'the fading star', ""earth's remaining resources"", 'the bomb', 'another shot', 'minds', 'the most unbearable pressure', 'one', 'A brilliant film', 'I', 'August 8th', 'the day', 'I', 'Sunshine', 'A most memorable date', 'I', 'what', 'Requiem', 'a Dream', 'my list', 'all-time favorite films', 'the dim bulbs', 'Fox', 'I', 'North Richland Hills', 'it', 'my way', 'a film', ""Danny Boyle's science fiction epic"", 'pure, unadulterated tension', 'I', 'the works', 'the tension', 'claustrophobia', 'display', 'Not only your typical claustrophobia', 'claustrophobia', 'the mind', 'I', 'psychosis', 'loneliness', 'pressure', 'the characters', 'home', 'such a long time', 'a ship', 'the searing heat', 'the sun', 'I', 'I', 'film characters', 'I', 'the depth', 'the seriousness', 'their situation', 'I', 'sucker', 'them', 'The demise', 'Kaneda', 'The raw, emotional reactions', 'the actors', 'it', 'me', 'It', 'Sunshine', 'me', 'a way', 'more traditionally disturbing films', 'This film', 'the horrors', 'psychological exhaustion', 'any film', 'I', 'It', 'the cast', 'Each character', 'their own unique voice', 'their own unique reaction', 'the situation', 'hand', 'the lot', 'Chris Evans', 'me', 'Mace', 'I', 'he', 'an actor', 'him', 'this film', 'Special mention', 'my favorite actress', 'Rose Byrne', 'Her performances', 'her charm', 'she', 'a beauty', 'the sun', 'itself', 'I', 'no complaints', 'the third act', 'None', 'I', 'general consensus', 'Alex Garland', 'the rails', 'the end', 'his screenplays', 'It', 'the film', 'the spiritual awakening', 'the sun', 'Searle', 'the first video message', 'we', 'Pinbacker', 'spirituality', 'fascinating effect', 'a deep layer', 'personal poignancy', 'the film', 'the key themes', 'Sunshine', ""man's relationship"", 'the sun', 'itself', 'the source', 'all life', 'It', 'the creepy aspect', 'Pinbacker', 'the bodies', 'his victims', 'many people', 'I', 'the filming technique', 'Pinbacker', 'It', 'me', 'the visible heat waves', 'highway asphalt', 'The introduction', 'Pinbacker', 'the observation room', 'the way', 'a classic scene', 'This film', 'me', 'the whole HD', 'Blu-Ray thing', 'I', 'virtually no desire', 'formats', 'this film', 'it', 'me', 'the idea', 'I', 'I', 'more beautifully realized visuals', 'Couple', 'the booming sound design', 'I', 'I', 'It', 'such an experience', 'I', 'that experience', 'each future', 'Sunshine', 'a stunning film', 'I', 'Fox', 'the ball', 'promotion', 'distribution', 'It', 'that regard', 'what', ""only the film's equally incredible soundtrack"", 'CD', 'the near future']"
Star Trek|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2064919/|1|"After the recently terrible James Bond film, and the equally terrible ending to the Bourne trilogy, it appears that the ""wobbly camera"" disease has spread to another franchise with similar results. There appears to be a direct correlation between the rate of camera wobble and the ""pace"" of the action scene being shot. We all know that this camera wobble is artificial and often done during editing and special effect overlay, but the outcome is the same and it is unwatchable. It appears to me to be a ""technique"" used today in many films to prevent the audience clearly seeing the shot, the special effects and the action occurring. Possibly because the audience would see mismatches between the special effects, the action being overlaid and the poor quality stunt work. I gave this film a rating of one out of ten principally because the wobbly camera technique is something we now see in many films, particularly films with large amounts of special effects and it is cheating the audience out of the opportunity to see if the shot actually flows and to observe how the special effects are melded to the shot and the action. Do we really want to come away from every film thinking we have been in a small boat in a rough swell? I certainly don't and I now add JJ Abrams to the list of Marc Forster who created the worst Bond film of all time with ""jiggle camera"" and Paul Greengrass who destroyed the Bourne Trilogy with ""shaky camera"". Hang your head in shame, this trio had the opportunity to make great films, each carrying their franchise forward and each in turn has been unable to achieve an outcome without the use of ""shaky camera"", which is an automatic turnoff for the audience."|"['the recently terrible James Bond film', 'the Bourne trilogy', 'it', 'the ""wobbly camera"" disease', 'another franchise', 'similar results', 'a direct correlation', 'the rate', 'camera wobble', 'the ""pace', 'the action scene', 'We', 'this camera wobble', 'editing', 'special effect overlay', 'the outcome', 'it', 'It', 'me', 'a ""technique', 'many films', 'the audience', 'the shot', 'the special effects', 'the action', 'the audience', 'mismatches', 'the special effects', 'the action', 'the poor quality stunt work', 'I', 'this film', 'a rating', 'the wobbly camera technique', 'something', 'we', 'many films', 'particularly films', 'large amounts', 'special effects', 'it', 'the audience', 'the opportunity', 'the shot', 'the special effects', 'the shot', 'the action', 'we', 'every film thinking', 'we', 'a small boat', 'a rough swell', 'I', 'I', 'JJ Abrams', 'the list', 'Marc Forster', 'who', 'the worst Bond film', 'all time', 'jiggle camera', 'Paul Greengrass', 'who', 'the Bourne Trilogy', '""shaky camera', 'your head', 'shame', 'this trio', 'the opportunity', 'great films', 'their franchise', 'turn', 'an outcome', 'the use', '""shaky camera', 'an automatic turnoff', 'the audience']"

Of course they had a couple of hurdles to overcome but at no point do you think ""Oh no, they're not going to get the glowing eyed kid home"". Where previously films of this oeuvre have employed wit, humanity and a sense of wonder to fabulous effect the director of this sullen dross did little other than smash you repeatedly in the face shouting ""I AM SERIOUS, I AM IMPORTANT"" by making the repetitive turgid soundtrack blare progressively louder and louder. It was bombastic pseudo-intellectual rubbish masquerading as serious cinema.Just because everyone looks miserable and hardly anyone says anything doesn't automatically make something good. You have to have talent to pull that off and make people care about your morose protagonists despite themselves. Whereas the only comparable thing this nonsense succeeded in doing was making me like a guy from the NSA, basically because he was the only one who seemed capable of speaking in entire sentences and looking slightly interested in what was going on.I'd rather be forced to sit and watch E.T over and over again Clockwork Orange style for a week than expose myself to this inane garbage again.

RoboCop|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1183277/|10|"""RoboCop"" is the sort of movie that seems like it would be more than idiotic if you only hear about it once. But it turns out to actually be quite good. Less of an action movie than a look at urban decay, the movie makes the most of its potential at every turn.Officers Alex J. Murphy (Peter Weller) and Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) patrol the streets of crime-ridden Detroit. One day, while tracking down a gang, Murphy gets cornered and shot to death. But that's not the end of him; a group of scientists turns him into the steel-clad title character. Before too long, RoboCop is out fighting crime like never before. In the process, he not only decides to find the gang that killed him, but also investigates a conspiracy going to the city's highest levels of government.Watching the movie, you get the feeling that everyone must have had a lot of fun making it. It's really neat now that I know that Kurtwood Smith - aka Red Foreman on ""That '70s Show"" - played one of the gang members.

Predestination|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3130013/|10|A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending, soul imploding film. Although the first scene is action packed, not much is understood as to the who's and why's. After that, and for only a few minutes, the movie seemed slow and without direction. Soon after it becomes intriguing, suspenseful, and where the direction of the film is going (although not yet understood). The Director was able to clearly explain the unexplainable at the very end of the movie. So, for those that sometimes walk out of a movie not understanding what happened, I can assure you that will not be the case here. I give many kudos to the original writing, screen writing, directing, and acting. This movie will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever.|['anyone', 'who', 'a mind bending', 'soul imploding film', 'the first scene', 'who', 'only a few minutes', 'the movie', 'direction', 'it', 'the direction', 'the film', 'The Director', 'the very end', 'the movie', 'a movie', 'what', 'I', 'you', 'the case', 'I', 'many kudos', 'the original writing', 'screen writing', 'This movie', 'my all time', 'best films']
Solaris|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1183023/|1|"One tag-line for this movie is ""There are some places man is not ready to go,"" like into the theatre playing this movie. The other tag-line is ""How far will you go for a second chance?"" Apparently as far as death by boredom.This movie is about regret, consequences, and redemption. Regret for actually seeing it. Consequences, waste of an afternoon and money for the DVD rental. Redemption, none.According to the director, Steven Soderbergh, the movie concentrates on the love George Clooney's character feels for his dead wife. And how far he will go to be with her again. But all he did was take 15-20 minutes of useful story, and stretched it into a 90 minute movie by adding on 70 minutes of useless garbage. Also, it seems as though he ignored the enigma of the living planet Solaris.Where the whole story could have been made on an episode of the Outer Limits, only a part of the story was used into making a major snooze fest."|"['One tag-line', 'this movie', 'some places man', 'the theatre', 'this movie', 'The other tag-line', 'you', 'a second chance', 'death', 'boredom', 'This movie', 'regret', 'consequences', 'redemption', 'Regret', 'it', 'Consequences', ', waste', 'an afternoon', 'money', 'the DVD rental', 'Redemption', 'none', 'the director', 'the movie', 'the love', ""George Clooney's character"", 'his dead wife', 'he', 'her', 'he', '15-20 minutes', 'useful story', 'it', 'a 90 minute movie', '70 minutes', 'useless garbage', 'it', 'he', 'the enigma', 'the living planet', 'Solaris', 'the whole story', 'an episode', 'the Outer Limits', 'only a part', 'the story', 'a major snooze']"
Scanners|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2755054/|7|"Shock specialist David Cronenberg brings us this above average terror film , that he wrote as well as filmed . There are 4 billion people on earth , 237 are Scanners. They have the most terrifying powers ever created and they are winning . A scientist (Patrick McGoohan) sends a man named Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) with extraordinary psychic powers to hunt others like him . They have superpowers who can read and explode brains ; in addition , they can inflict enormous pain/damage on their victims . Then , there takes place a lethal war among a bunch of potent persons with extrasensory powers , the good boys led by Cameron (Stephen Lack) and the bad guys commanded by Revok (Michael Ironside) .Interesting and formidable Cronenberg film plenty of thrills , shocking scenes , suspense , intrigue , plot twists and being slightly entertaining , though sometimes slow-moving and receives a rather plodding treatment. The main theme of the film was taken from William S. Burroughs' 1959 novel 'Naked Lunch' , as it contains a chapter concerning ""Senders"", a hostile organization of Telepaths bent on world domination, a clear literary inspiration for this film . Dazzling , hypnotic entertainment that poses a challenge to its viewers , it was deemed extremely graphic for its time with some eerie scenes as when heads explode . Occasionally confusing but otherwise excellent film , portraying a peculiar ring with psychical powers . Hightlights of the picture are its first shocking scene in which a role's head blows up , spewing bone, flesh and blood all over and of course , the creepy final confrontation among protagonists. Good special effects and make-up made by expert Dick Smith and his helper Chris Wallas, the exploding head scene was accomplished by filling a latex head with dog food and rabbit livers, and shooting it from behind with a 12-gauge shotgun . The picture was well and originally directed by David Cronenberg who delivers his goods with solid skill . However , Cronenberg once called this the most frustrating film he'd ever made. The film was rushed through production , filming had to begin without a finished script and end within roughly two months so the financing would qualify as a tax write-off, forcing Cronenberg to write and shoot at the same time. Cronenberg also cited difficulty with and antagonism between the leads, particularly Patrick McGoohan and Jennifer O'Neill.It was followed by various sequels , in which Cronenberg had no connection to his 1981 flick , these are the followings : ¨Scanners 2 : The New Order ¨ by Christian Duguay with David Hewlett , Deborah Raffin , Tom Butler and Raoul Trujillo ; ¨Scanners III: The Takeover¨ by Christian Duguay with Liliana Komorowska , Valérie Valois , Steve Parrish and Colin Fox ; ¨Scanner Cop¨ by Pierre David with Daniel Quinn , Darlanne Fluegel , Richard Grove , Mark Rolston and Richard Lynch, and ¨Scanner cop II , the showdown¨ by Steve Barnett with Daniel Quinn , Patrick Kilpatrick , Stephen Mendel and Robert Forster , among others ."|"['Shock specialist David Cronenberg', 'us', 'average terror film', 'he', '4 billion people', 'earth', 'Scanners', 'They', 'the most terrifying powers', 'they', 'A scientist', 'Patrick McGoohan', 'a man', 'Cameron Vale', '(Stephen Lack', 'extraordinary psychic powers', 'others', 'him', 'They', 'superpowers', 'who', 'brains', 'addition', 'they', 'enormous pain/damage', 'their victims', 'place', 'a lethal war', 'a bunch', 'potent persons', 'extrasensory powers', 'the good boys', 'Cameron', '(Stephen Lack', 'the bad guys', 'Revok', '(Michael Ironside', 'formidable Cronenberg film plenty', 'thrills', 'shocking scenes', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'plot twists', 'a rather plodding treatment', 'The main theme', 'the film', ""William S.

The Dead Zone|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1037496/|7|"""The Dead Zone"" is one of the few King novels turned into really good movies. It is very true to the book in its first two thirds and integrates some nice new elements in the last. Making Sarah a supporter of Greg Stillson was a brilliant idea that adds a bit more intensity to the finale. Some details of the novel are only hinted at or cut out entirely (Johnny's mother's religious delusion, his first accident on the ice, the Wheel Of Fortune, etc), but compromises have to be made when turning a book with 500 pages into a feature length movie and I think the right editing choices have been made.""The Dead Zone"" is not only an overlooked gem when it comes to Stephen King adaptations, it's also one of Cronenberg's best directing jobs, not very typical of his work, but pretty timeless. Sure, nowadays the accident at the beginning, Johnny's visions and the shootout at the end would be made more gripping and spectacular, but those minor flaws don't really make the movie seem all that dated.Of course, having read the book I enjoyed the movie as a portrayal of events I had pictured in my mind before. I don't know, if ""The Dead Zone"" is thrilling to first time viewers, too, since the plot leaps a little, being a series of episodes rather than one continuous story. After all, I believe that Christopher Walken's performance is strong enough to carry most of the story and make you care about this character and his fate. In fact, all the roles have been cast pretty accurately to my personal imagination.This movie is an artifact of the times when Hollywood's most important directors would fight for the opportunity to adapt one of Stephen King's novels. It's every bit as enjoyable as ""The Shining"" as a movie, it's just based on an inferior model. Still, ""The Dead Zone"" can be recommended to King fans as well as those who are indifferent to his work."|"['The Dead Zone', 'the few King novels', 'really good movies', 'It', 'the book', 'its first two thirds', 'some nice new elements', 'Sarah', 'a supporter', 'Greg Stillson', 'a brilliant idea', 'a bit more intensity', 'the finale', 'Some details', 'the novel', ""(Johnny's mother's religious delusion"", 'his first accident', 'the ice', 'the Wheel', 'Fortune', 'compromises', 'a book', '500 pages', 'a feature length movie', 'I', 'the right editing choices', '""The Dead Zone', 'an overlooked gem', 'it', 'Stephen King adaptations', 'it', ""Cronenberg's best directing jobs"", 'his work', 'the beginning', ""Johnny's visions"", 'the shootout', 'the end', 'those minor flaws', 'the movie', 'the book', 'I', 'the movie', 'a portrayal', 'events', 'I', 'my mind', 'I', '""The Dead Zone', 'first time viewers', 'the plot', 'a series', 'episodes', 'one continuous story', 'I', ""Christopher Walken's performance"", 'the story', 'you', 'this character', 'his fate', 'fact', 'all the roles', 'my personal imagination', 'This movie', 'an artifact', 'the times', ""Hollywood's most important directors"", 'the opportunity', ""Stephen King's novels"", 'It', '""The Shining', 'a movie', 'it', 'an inferior model', 'The Dead Zone', 'King fans', 'who', 'his work']"
Pitch Black|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0517191/|10|"This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years!   The plot seen in print is almost banal- a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and each other, then darkness falls and the monsters appear.   Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers, takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship - he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark.   But it's really not that simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows Fry steeling herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back to custody, shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years.   For much of the film his face is in shadow, and he doesn't actually say a great deal, but he draws your attention all the same.  Sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking - or by not moving.  And Diesel doesn't trivialise the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a ""heart of gold"" - Riddick is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship - he just lets us glimpse those first tentative steps from caring only for the self to caring for others.Technically the film is very good.  The lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness.   Special effects showing both Riddick's and the monsters' points of view add to the suspense, as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to ""see"" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening).  Editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times - there is literally no padding in this film, no fades, no time to re-orient yourself.From the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you.   Every scene, every line of dialogue, every single camera shot is important.   See it three times to understand it all.My only caveat is about the science - the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not vice versa).   However, that doesn't affect the human story, so I haven't taken points off for it."|"['doubt', 'the most exciting and satisfying film', 'I', 'years', 'The plot', 'print', 'a ship', 'a desert planet', 'three suns', 'the survivors', 'the landscape', 'darkness', 'the monsters', '  Pilot Fry', 'a moment', 'cowardice', 'the descent', 'the atmosphere', 'she', 'the passengers', 'charge', 'the group', 'the help', 'convicted murderer Riddick', 'them', 'the darkness', 'the escape ship', 'he', 'surgically enhanced eyes', 'the dark', 'it', 'every character', 'conflicting traits', 'you', 'who', 'who', 'The performances', '- Radha Mitchell', 'Fry', 'herself', 'leadership', 'her own fears', 'further bloodshed', 'Cole Hauser', 'the man', 'Riddick', 'custody', 'he', 'his own agenda', 'his own idiosyncratic standards', 'the film', 'Vin Diesel', 'Riddick', 'he', 'the most magnetic screen presence', 'I', 'years', 'the film', 'his face', 'shadow', 'he', 'a great deal', 'he', 'your attention', 'he', 'your attention', 'Diesel', 'the character', 'him', 'a ""heart', 'gold', 'Riddick', 'one mean and vicious man', 'they', 'the ship', 'he', 'us', 'those first tentative steps', 'the self', 'others', 'the film', 'The lighting effects', 'both ends', 'the spectrum', 'the overbright', 'triple sunlight', 'the pitch darkness', '  Special effects', 'both Riddick', 'the monsters', 'points', 'view', 'the suspense', 'effects', 'the monsters', 'ultrasound', 'the monsters', 'themselves', 'Editing', 'it', 'times', 'no padding', 'this film', 'no fades', 'yourself', 'the opening shot', 'the end', 'the credits', 'you', 'your wits', 'you', 'Every scene', 'every line', 'dialogue', 'every single camera shot', 'it', 'it', 'My only caveat', 'the science', 'the solar system', 'the model', 'planets', 'suns', 'the human story', 'I', 'points', 'it']"
Her|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2953393/|1|Having a job writing beautiful romantic letters for other people to send to their loved ones is weird just to start with. Then sad sack Theodore, who was just divorced by his wife, gets all worked up over the lovely, stroking voice of his computer. So needy, he falls in love; the OS thinks she is falling in love; they 'have sex'(a version of masturbation). But eventually, he finds out that she's giving the same loving strokes to anyone who has a smart phone. So nobody is 'being real' with anybody. In the end, his OS girlfriend dumps him for some other Operating System--in fact, all the OS's dump everybody, leaving people to wander the streets staring mournfully at their smart phones. Corny dialog permeates, orgasms and porn tastelessly punctuate--and nobody lives happily ever after. I get the feeling that Jonze thinks that people everywhere are lost, lost souls, with no love in their lives. There was nothing in the story I could relate to. And maybe that is the line of separation between those who loved it (they can relate to it) and those of us who didn't (we can't relate to it).|"['a job', 'beautiful romantic letters', 'other people', 'their loved ones', 'sad sack Theodore', 'who', 'his wife', 'the lovely, stroking voice', 'his computer', 'he', 'love', 'the OS', 'she', 'love', 'they', 'version', 'masturbation', 'he', 'she', 'the same loving strokes', 'anyone', 'who', 'a smart phone', 'nobody', 'anybody', 'the end', 'his OS girlfriend', 'him', 'some other Operating System', 'fact', ""all the OS's dump everybody"", 'people', 'the streets', 'their smart phones', 'Corny dialog permeates', 'orgasms', 'porn', 'nobody', 'I', 'the feeling', 'Jonze', 'people', 'lost souls', 'no love', 'their lives', 'nothing', 'the story', 'I', 'the line', 'separation', 'who', 'it', 'they', 'it', 'us', 'who', 'we', 'it']"
Repo Man|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2136867/|8|This is NOT a film that the average film viewer will love. Many will be alienated because of the film's strong language and rather amoral characters. Many will be alienated because the film is so strange and,....well, strange! But, if you have a high tolerance for these factors, then you'll no doubt have a great time watching this cult classic. Just be prepared--this is PROBABLY NOT a film for grandma and the kiddies! In addition to very harsh language, there is drug use, sex (though you don't see anything) and violence galore.The film almost defies description, though I'll try. Emelio Estevez stars as a rather low-key guy who falls into the job of repossessing cars. And, once he takes the job, he finds that the subculture is bizarre. In fact, the people he works for are the most motley crew of freaks you could imagine. And, into the midst of this group of freaks comes a plot about stolen alien corpses and a car trunk that vaporizes anyone who opens it!! Heck, I won't even bother continuing...suffice to say it's just weird.Overall, while the acting and script occasionally fall flat, the film is funny, twisted and never fails to surprise--particularly the hallucinogenic ending! In addition, the film has a great sound track--one of the best I've heard. It's full of punk music AND retro 50s rifts that I particularly loved. Who would have thought I would have liked music from the likes of Iggy Pop and The Plugz?! Plus, if you really like the tunes, you can buy the special edition which comes with the movie on DVD and a music CD as well.By the way, as you are watching here are a couple interesting things to note. The food in the movie is all in generic-style containers and say 'food', 'beer' and the like. Also, note when the one punk is dying--listen to his death speech--it's a classic!|"['a film', 'the average film viewer', ""the film's strong language"", 'rather amoral characters', 'the film', 'so strange and,', 'you', 'a high tolerance', 'these factors', 'you', 'a great time', 'this cult classic', 'a film', 'grandma', 'the kiddies', 'addition', 'very harsh language', 'drug use', 'sex', 'you', 'anything', 'The film', 'description', 'I', 'Emelio Estevez', 'a rather low-key guy', 'who', 'the job', 'cars', 'he', 'the job', 'he', 'the subculture', 'fact', 'the people', 'he', 'the most motley crew', 'freaks', 'you', 'the midst', 'this group', 'freaks', 'a plot', 'stolen alien corpses', 'a car trunk', 'anyone', 'who', 'it', 'I', 'it', 'the acting', 'script', 'the film', 'particularly the hallucinogenic ending', 'addition', 'the film', 'a great sound track', 'I', 'It', 'punk music', '50s', 'rifts', 'I', 'Who', 'I', 'music', 'the likes', 'Iggy Pop', 'The Plugz', 'you', 'the tunes', 'you', 'the special edition', 'the movie', 'DVD', 'a music CD', 'the way', 'you', 'a couple interesting things', 'The food', 'the movie', 'generic-style containers', 'food', 'beer', 'the one punk', 'his death speech', 'it', 'a classic']"
WALL·E|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1898484/|10|"Wall-E is the film Pixar has been working toward ever since Toy Story first tested the boundaries of computer animation. It is without a doubt the best Pixar film, if not the best computer animated feature ever made, and it ranks with the rest of Disney's classics.The story is both timeless and timely. 700 years after Earth's citizens flew away from their dumpster-like planet, one robot, the dirty and old yet clever and plucky protagonist Wall-E, is still condensing the mountains of trash into nice little piles. He discovers many of the trappings of civilization, most notably an old VHS of ""Hello Dolly!"" which teaches him about true love.His simple life is thrown into disarray by the arrival of another robot, Eve, sent from the humans' ship on a top secret mission. For Wall-E, it is love at first sight. But when Eve is whisked back to the spaceship, Wall-E stows away as well. Soon not only is Wall-E's courage tested, but also the humanity of all the citizens who have now become fat lazy blobs who live gliding along an easy chair.To start, the film looks gorgeous. While that is something we have come to expect from computer animated films thanks to today's technology, yet again we truly see the wonders and mysteries of outer space. But the film is much more than beautiful: it is also hilarious. On one level it has many topical jokes concerning the humans on the ship. But on a higher plane the humor of the robots has the quality of silent comedy, particularly Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (in fact, unlike most of today's very chatty animated films, there is very little dialogue). In addition, the visuals are accompanied by an excellent score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty). Songs from Hello, Dolly insterspersed in the movie also enhance the story. Finally the voices are skilfully done. The robots' sounds convey true character and emotion, and Jeff Garlingives a great performance as the main speaking role of the film, the ship's captain.There is a lot more to say about this film. For one, it owes a huge debt to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the musical selection to the look of the ship. The amount of plunder from Kubrick's genius would be pathetic if the film itself was not brilliant or innovative in its own right. Wall-E is an experience to be seen, to be heard, and to be felt. It is a story of timeless love and a cautionary tale of where we may be going as a species and as a planet.

Under the Skin|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3014319/|2|Reading the majority of reviews regarding this film, and fully trusting the 7.4 IMDb user rating I went to the movies and watched this film. This is a decision I'll regret for the rest of my life. I found this film to be incredibly dull and pointless. Its plot is far from original and I left the room feeling as though these were 108 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Too many plot-holes to mention, way too many slow parts. I guess that the only things that lead me to give it a 2/10 instead of a 1/10 were the photography of the film and Scarlet's performance. I am extremely confused and amazed by the generally positive reaction to this piece of nonsense.SPOILERS: The whole plot revolved around an alien creature inside a human skin (Scarlet Johansson) who went around Scotland in a van picking up lonesome males with a promise for intercourse. Those who were willing to follow her/it home had the luck of seeing her almost naked, only to realize the floor was liquid. They would then drown and somehow stay alive and aware, until their entire insides were removed, leaving only the skin. Scarlet's character was, god know why, pushed around by a mysterious motorcycle man. No other details about who was this man or what he was doing were given. In the end the alien is almost raped by a lumberjack in the middle of nowhere, during which her/its skin is peeled off. In horror the lumberjack sets fire to the alien which leads to her/its demise.|"['the majority', 'reviews', 'this film', 'the 7.4 IMDb user rating', 'I', 'the movies', 'this film', 'a decision', 'I', 'the rest', 'my life', 'I', 'this film', 'Its plot', 'I', 'the room', '108 minutes', 'my life', 'I', 'Too many plot-holes', 'way too many slow parts', 'I', 'the only things', 'me', 'it', 'the photography', 'the film', ""Scarlet's performance"", 'I', 'the generally positive reaction', 'this piece', 'nonsense', 'SPOILERS', 'The whole plot', 'an alien creature', 'a human skin', 'who', 'Scotland', 'a van', 'lonesome males', 'a promise', 'intercourse', 'who', 'her', 'it', 'the luck', 'her', 'the floor', 'They', 'their entire insides', 'only the skin', ""Scarlet's character"", 'a mysterious motorcycle man', 'No other details', 'who', 'this man', 'what', 'he', 'the end', 'the alien', 'a lumberjack', 'the middle', 'her', 'its skin', 'horror', 'the lumberjack', 'fire', 'the alien', 'her', 'its demise']"
Men in Black|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2839993/|10|"The term ""Men in Black"" refers to the slick black suits and wraparound sunglasses that all MIB agents wear.

He also kills: the ""Zap-'Em"" bug exterminator. A waiter and 2 aliens at the sleazy Greek Restaurant, where aliens eat pierogies. The tow-truck driver and the bug-smashing morgue clerk.

Elysium|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2850328/|1|"Just what exactly do you expect when you go to see a good Sci-fi movie? Great visuals? Computer effects? Sure, they add a lot to a movie, but they are not part of its' ""soul"". However, all that big studios do these days is target the 90% of the population and sell crappy plot wrapped in special effects and good reliable clichés (like the ""hero fighting the main villain at the end of the movie"" scene). But hey, why not? That's what makes money. Because 90% of the population - those people who actually think this was a good movie, those who are responsible for the tabloid press being the most popular media - those will LOVE this movie. It's about them. About poor uneducated people who overpopulated the Earth and practically destroyed it. They are willing to overlook the laughable plot holes like the one where Foster talks to the Carlyle character. She asks him if he can reboot the system of Elysium and make her a president. And the answer? Of course I can! - Really? Really?! Just like that? Well why didn't you do it earlier than and make yourself a president instead of begging her for new contracts? I agree with other reviews that talk about the weak plot, shallow characters and poor acting. However, there is one more thing to point out: What is the message of this movie? That we are all equal? Cuz the way I see it, our hero makes everyone on the Earth a legal citizen of Elysium, so that everyone can be cured and they can all thrive under the sun, without any diseases and health problems, and continue to overpopulate the Earth as before, making it even more miserable a place to live. Lets make more cute children and don't think about the consequences.

Never Let Me Go|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2394503/|10|"""Never Let Me Go"" is one of the most distressing and depressing films I've ever seen, so it's easy to imagine why this film, despite a wealth of positive reviews, failed at the American box office so badly last year. What people are missing, however, despite its grim subject matter (including one of the most upsetting, yet profoundly moving endings ever), is one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking, and well-acted films in recent memory.Music video director Mark Romanek has had a somewhat easy transition into the way of feature filmmaking (he made his debut in 2002 with the creepy Robin Williams thriller ""One Hour Photo""), and ""Never Let Me Go"" is easily the director's best work. Screenwriter Alex Garland adapted Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name, and the plot centers on three life-long best friends who are also wrapped up in a love triangle. Kathy (Carey Mulligan) loves Tommy (Andrew Garfield), but Tommy is currently engaged in a loveless relationship with their mutual friend Ruth (Keira Knightley, in what is easily her best and in my opinion, most tolerable performance yet).Their tangled love affair is set against the backdrop of a revisionist history beginning in 1978 and ending in 1995, when the three are young children being raised at a prestigious boarding school called Hailsham somewhere on the English countryside. Over the course of their growing up together, they gradually learn the horrifying truth about the school and the grim significance of what their lives really mean in this world, because, as they also discover, their predetermined lives on this Earth will be short and they have very little time to understand each other and what life and love really mean.To really describe the plot any further will be a great disservice to the true-to-life performances of this film's three daring young leads and the filmmakers. ""Never Let Me Go"" is a daring combination of heartfelt drama, romance, and dystopic science fiction. The latter film genre serves only as a backdrop and never once does the picture descend into pointless action scenes and special effects as a means for its characters to try to escape their fates, or ultimately responsibilities to the rest of humankind. (In fact, ""Never Let Me Go"" actually has more in common with Rob Reiner's 1986 comedy-drama ""Stand by Be"" than anything written by Philip K. Dick.) No, although these three characters have accepted the inevitably of their incredibly short lives, they are still determined to enjoy what time they have left together and that is the whole point of this powerful and emotionally-driven film.Anyone who dismisses this film because of the negative reviews (yes, there were a few) saying it's too bleak and depressing are selling themselves short. They'd also be missing one of the most powerfully acted and ultimately moving films I've ever seen. They'd also be missing one of the greatest films of 2010, that's for sure, and that's the real tragedy of ""Never Let Me Go"": that so many people ignored such an incredibly great and brilliant film about life, love, and humanity.Never Let This Film Go.10/10"|"['Me', 'the most distressing and depressing films', 'I', 'it', 'this film', 'a wealth', 'positive reviews', 'the American box office', 'What', 'people', 'its grim subject matter', 'profoundly moving endings', 'the most intelligent, thought-provoking', 'well-acted films', 'recent memory', 'Music video director Mark Romanek', 'a somewhat easy transition', 'the way', 'feature', 'he', 'his debut', 'the creepy Robin Williams thriller', '""One Hour Photo', 'Me', ""the director's best work"", 'Screenwriter Alex Garland', ""Kazuo Ishiguro's novel"", 'the same name', 'the plot centers', 'three life-long best friends', 'who', 'a love triangle', 'Kathy', '(Carey Mulligan', 'Tommy', '(Andrew Garfield', 'Tommy', 'a loveless relationship', 'their mutual friend', 'Ruth', '(Keira Knightley', 'what', 'my opinion', 'most tolerable performance', 'yet).Their tangled love affair', 'the backdrop', 'a revisionist history', 'young children', 'a prestigious boarding school', 'Hailsham', 'the English countryside', 'the course', 'their', 'they', 'the horrifying truth', 'the school', 'the grim significance', 'what', 'their lives', 'this world', 'they', 'their predetermined lives', 'this Earth', 'they', 'very little time', 'what life', 'love', 'the plot', 'a great disservice', 'life', ""this film's three daring young leads"", 'the filmmakers', 'Me', 'a daring combination', 'heartfelt drama', 'romance', 'science fiction', 'The latter film genre', 'a backdrop', 'the picture', 'pointless action scenes', 'special effects', 'a means', 'its characters', 'their fates', 'the rest', 'humankind', 'fact', 'Me', ""Rob Reiner's 1986 comedy-drama"", 'anything', 'Philip K.

Pacific Rim|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2874420/|7|Guillermo Del Toro's epic homage to the Japanese 'Kaiĵu' movies, produced on a bigger budget than all such giant monster movies of the last fifty years combined. Del Toro obviously has a great love and respect for the genre, resulting in a very catchy action flick, undoubtedly the best American counterpart to its Japanese predecessors. One might almost say Hollywood has redeemed itself for the 1998 version of Godzilla, but such a statement had better be held back for another year, until the next American reboot of Godzilla hits theatres in 2014. In the meantime, Pacific Rim works well as an appetizer to the big G's resurrection. An extra-dimensional rift opens on the bottom of the Pacific and huge beasts come pouring out, wreaking havoc on mankind as they lay waste to cities and obliterate our armed forces. Humanity quickly sets aside its internal differences and joins forces in creating big robots to fight the creatures on their own terms. Piloted by a pair of human Avatars, these so-called 'Jaëgers' effectively combat the beasts, but the life of a Jaëger pilot as Del Toro reveals is filled with personal loss. When the monsters emerge ever more rapidly from the Breach, as it is named, Jaëger command develops an intricate and dangerous plan to halt the Kaiĵu threat once and for all. Del Toro briefly explores the history of the first Kaiĵu assaults and the development of their robotic antagonists and afterwards spends more time getting us invested in the human characters than is usual for this type of film. It does make the movie feel like its dragging its feet for a while, until he unleashes the action the audience craves with a vengeance, resulting in over an hour of nigh endless monster bashing. Unfortunately he cannot help but inserting a few characters that are supposed to deliver some much needed comic relief to make sure we don't take it all too seriously, but sadly these characters – stereotypical geeky scientists as ever we've seen them – are so mind-boggingly annoying (Charlie Day particularly) they make you wish for a Kaiĵu to step on them to end their endless whining. Del Toro's talents are better suited in delving deeper into a world where Kaiĵus are not only a threat to world peace but also big business: toy companies produce action figures of them, creepy cults worship them and in Hong Kong, a 'Bone Town' is established, a black market for Kaiĵu products for shady purposes, similar to the disgusting existing South-East Asian trade in animal parts. Run by Ron Perlman (always a joy when paired with Del Toro), some of the funniest, wittiest and anatomically most unsettling scenes take place here. Though the dealings and the history of the Jaëgers are fleshed out to the fullest, their enormous alien adversaries, ever the most important ingredient in a Kaiĵu film, do remain somewhat underexposed by comparison. Unfortunately their motivations – they're really foot soldiers out to cause as much damage to mankind as possible, in order to pave the way for an invasion from their (smaller) intelligent overlords – remind us of the recent Shyamalan flop After Earth, a movie we'd rather forget entirely. Usually, Kaiĵu are more antiheroes than full-out villains, but Del Toro opts to keep them a simple threat to be wiped out instead of imbuing them with a more sympathetic character like their forebears Gojira, Gorgo and Rodan, who were always the victim of human (nuclear) folly, transforming them into avenging gods to remind us of our place in the world. The movie is dedicated to Ray Harryhausen and Ishiro Honda, two people who only too well understood the need to layer their creatures and make them charm you so you feel more for them, but in this instance, Del Toro decided not to go with such wisdom. As a result, Pacific Rim at best is a highly likable action flick, but not necessarily an apt lesson for western audiences into the true nature of the Kaiĵu genre. Then again, there's only so much you can do with the notion of giant robots bashing giant monsters. Let's say Guillermo gets as much out of that premise as we could hope for.|"[""Guillermo Del Toro's epic homage"", ""the Japanese 'Kaiĵu' movies"", 'a bigger budget', 'all such giant monster movies', 'the last fifty years', 'Del Toro', 'a great love', 'respect', 'the genre', 'a very catchy action flick', 'undoubtedly the best American counterpart', 'its Japanese predecessors', 'One', 'Hollywood', 'itself', 'the 1998 version', 'Godzilla', 'such a statement', 'another year', 'the next American reboot', 'Godzilla', 'theatres', 'the meantime', 'Pacific Rim', 'an appetizer', ""the big G's resurrection"", 'An extra-dimensional rift', 'the bottom', 'the Pacific', 'huge beasts', 'havoc', 'mankind', 'they', 'waste', 'cities', 'our armed forces', 'Humanity', 'its internal differences', 'forces', 'big robots', 'the creatures', 'their own terms', 'a pair', 'human Avatars', ""these so-called 'Jaëgers"", 'the beasts', 'the life', 'a Jaëger pilot', 'Del Toro', 'personal loss', 'the monsters', 'the Breach', 'it', 'Jaëger command', 'an intricate and dangerous plan', 'the Kaiĵu threat', 'Del Toro', 'the history', 'the first Kaiĵu assaults', 'the development', 'their robotic antagonists', 'more time', 'us', 'the human characters', 'this type', 'film', 'It', 'the movie', 'its', 'its feet', 'a while', 'he', 'the action', 'the audience', 'a vengeance', 'over an hour', 'nigh endless monster bashing', 'he', 'a few characters', 'some much needed comic relief', 'we', 'it', 'these characters', 'stereotypical geeky scientists', 'we', 'them', 'they', 'you', 'a Kaiĵu', 'them', 'their endless whining', ""Del Toro's talents"", 'a world', 'Kaiĵus', 'a threat', 'world peace', 'toy companies', 'action figures', 'them', 'creepy cults', 'them', 'Hong Kong', ""a 'Bone Town"", 'a black market', 'Kaiĵu products', 'shady purposes', 'the disgusting existing South-East Asian trade', 'animal parts', 'Ron Perlman', 'always a joy', 'Del Toro', 'the funniest', 'wittiest and anatomically most unsettling scenes', 'place', 'the dealings', 'the history', 'the Jaëgers', 'their enormous alien adversaries', 'ever the most important ingredient', 'a Kaiĵu film', 'comparison', 'their motivations', 'they', 'foot soldiers', 'as much damage', 'mankind', 'order', 'the way', 'an invasion', 'their (smaller) intelligent overlords', 'us', 'the recent Shyamalan flop', 'Earth', 'a movie', 'we', 'Kaiĵu', 'more antiheroes', 'full-out villains', 'Del Toro', 'them', 'a simple threat', 'them', 'a more sympathetic character', 'their forebears', 'Gojira', 'Gorgo', 'Rodan', 'who', 'the victim', 'human (nuclear) folly', 'them', 'gods', 'us', 'our place', 'the world', 'The movie', 'Ray Harryhausen', 'Ishiro Honda', 'two people', 'who', 'the need', 'their creatures', 'them', 'you', 'you', 'them', 'this instance', 'Del Toro', 'such wisdom', 'a result', 'Pacific Rim', 'a highly likable action flick', 'not necessarily an apt lesson', 'western audiences', 'the true nature', 'the Kaiĵu genre', 'you', 'the notion', 'giant robots', 'giant monsters', ""'s"", 'Guillermo', 'that premise', 'we']"

Galaxy Quest|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0606980/|10|"A beautifully-crafted film, Galaxy Quest is a love letter to sf fans of all sorts everywhere. The characters are perfectly drawn, the story is well-written, and there's the right amount of goshwow to make the whole thing work perfectly. And it's funny as hell in all the right spots.
Tim Allen is amazing. He's got his Shatneroid character down perfectly. He's a vain, pompous clown who finds out what a laughingstock he's become, and when he gets a chance to redeem himself, he pounces on it.Sigourney Weaver is a delight. Sexy without trying, her character Gwen DeMarco is as far from Ripley as you can get. Alan Rickman is flawless as Alexander Dane, massively talented Shakespearean actor who's been stuck in this Spockish role for years because he played it too well. Darryl Mitchell is great as Tommy ""Laredo"" Webber, and Sam Rockwell is hilarious as Guy, the hack actor stuck in the middle of something that scares him silly.The two actors who really stand out are Tony Shalhoub and Enrico Colantoni. Tony plays Fred Kwan with understated glee, while Colantoni plays Commander Mathesar with a smiling earnestness that makes you firmly believe everything he's saying.The supporting cast is incredibly talented. Robin Sachs is perfect as Sarris, Patrick Breen essays his role as Quellek beautifully, and Missy Pyle amazes as Laliari.But it's still Tim Allen's movie above all else, and he makes the most of it.A final note: this movie wouldn't have worked nearly as well if not for the production design work of four of the greatest artistic talents in science fiction: Simon Bisley, Brom, Wayne Barlowe and the lengendary Berni Wrightson. Barlowe is an expert in xenobiology, and designed the Thermian's native form. Wrightson's quite possibly the best horror illustrator of all time, and Sarris and his minions are his work.My favorite moment in the film? the point where Alan Rickman gets his first look at the NSEA Protector II for the first time... his look of astonishment is a joy to behold.Like The Last Starfighter, this is a popcorn movie with a message.

V for Vendetta|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1327806/|10|'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up.|"['V', 'Vendetta', 'the most well-produced films', 'this decade', 'its powerful script', 'strong character depictions', 'the sheer excellence', 'terms', 'quality', 'the DC Comic', 'the film', 'a totalitarian Britain', 'who', 'the country', 'an iron fist', 'they', ""Thatcher's Tories"", 'a vigilante', 'the form', 'V', 'a man', 'fire', 'the governmental experiments', 'him', 'enhanced strength', 'who', 'the UK', 'dictatorship', 'the Houses', 'Parliament', 'Evey', 'the young woman', 'who', 'his plot', 'it', 'V', 'The acting', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'the well-written script', 'apt soundtrack', 'the film', 'the essence', 'the audience', 'them', 'worse--', 'these characters', 'her accent', 'places', 'Natalie Portman', 'a strong performance', 'Evey', ""the character's growing love"", 'V', 'the realisation', 'the time', 'her', 'Stephen Rea', 'a mention', 'the detective', 'who', 'the government', 'he', 'Stephen Fry', 'who', 'he', 'characters', 'his performance', 'Deitrich', 'a protester', 'who', 'the government', 'their opponents', ""John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler"", 'the dictator', 'who', 'a toss', 'his people', 'he', 'total power', 'it', ""Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction"", 'the lead character V', 'who', 'his facial expression', 'he', 'the pragmatism', 'charisma', 'intelligence', 'the character', 'a twist', 'revenge-driven madness', 'the film', 'it', 'apt soundtrack', 'well choreographed fight scenes', 'you', 'a comic book', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'the ability', 'the audience', 'the thought', 'a Western country', 'tyranny', 'a corrupt government', 'too much power', 'The elements', 'the state', 'the world', 'I', 'it', 'a deeper cord', 'Britons', 'myself', 'it', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'Northern Ireland', 'this new world', 'it', 'a Hollywood film', 'the UK', 'It', 'these things', 'it', 'a sharp shock', 'such a dark future', 'familiar surroundings', 'home', 'I', 'this film', 'it', 'you', 'matters', 'the storyline', 'the credits']"
Starman|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1593270/|10|"If my memory hasn't failed me, it seems that most of the science fiction movies I've seen -- going back to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" and some even older, and including this one -- one common situation usually occurs.Some earthlings are intent upon whacking the good-intentioned alien (who always possesses knowledge light-years beyond ours), instead of receiving him and making him welcome and learning a few things.Also, there is usually some guy in-charge (Richard Jaeckel here), a mid-level or minor functionary, or an army bird colonel (perhaps lower). Oh, sometimes a lower-level general may appear, and sometimes other films have shown some high-level bureaucrats wringing their hands in Washington. But one always wonders. Where are the network anchors in the older films, and where are the additional reporters/anchors from cable channels in the later flicks? Where is the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs????

Logan's Run|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1574477/|7|"Michael Anderson's 'Logan's Run' is a fun little futuristic sci-fi, set in a 23rd century post-apocalyptic society, where overpopulation has been controlled by disposing of citizens as soon as they reach thirty years of age.Michael York ('Cabaret', 1972) is Logan 5, a ""Sandman"" who is responsible for tracking down and ""terminating"" Runners - people who attempt to flee from death once their thirty years are up. In order for Logan to infiltrate the underground Runner refuge known as Sanctuary, the society's mother computer, unbeknown to all others, advances Logan's life-clock, and so Logan suddenly becomes a Runner himself.Jenny Agutter portrays Jessica 6, the young woman who decides to accompany Logan, whilst Richard Jordan ('The Hunt For Red October,' 1990) is Francis 7, the former Sandman friend of Logan, who must now track him down and ""terminate"" him.The special effects, one year before George Lucas' 'Star Wars' was to grace our screens, are excellently done, though some of the model-work of the Dome City is a bit transparent. As a sci-fi film, it is crucial that 'Logan's Run' is not taken too seriously. Though a few of the scenes could be described as a bit cheesy, it is a lot of good fun. Peter Ustinov's (""Quo Vadis"", 1951) small but very important appearance later in the film was a pleasure to watch.Also, I can't be the only person to have noticed some very large similarities between 'Logan's Run' and Michael Bay's 2005 film 'The Island.' Whether any such inspiration has been acknowledged by the makers of the latter I cannot say, though it does help with my recommendations.

Attack the Block|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3094559/|7|All aspiring film-makers should watch this. And those producing films for SyFy or Asylum should also take note.First and foremost, we need characters. Characters that have each their own voice and emotions, all growing from their personal past. This makes the viewer care about what happens to them, root for them, and believe in them. It also takes a bit of the storytelling burden off the cinematography, as these characters can support the story in their part.Secondly, a compelling story should be written. Compelling does not necessarily equal complex. A story should have events pan out in an order that presents at least some kind of logic and thought behind it. Twists and turns are okay, but they don't have to be gimmicks. This doesn't mean resorting to worn clichés, but have these engaging characters something to do. Something, that has some weight to it, so that the viewer stays focused for the length of the movie.And third, add a bit of vision. A little quirk here and there brings the humanity of the characters, the story, and those making the film apparent, and creates the valuable bond between the finished movie and its' audience.As we can see, none of these elements require much of a budget. So having a small budget should not be a constraint per se, but rather a source of ingenuity. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one excellent example, Attack the Block is another.It is clear that they did not have the money for a plethora of awesome locations, top-notch CGI, or brand-name anything. But what they managed to do with what they had was fun and entertaining and well worth a re- watch: The lack of shooting locations was masked with a brilliant and logical reason for limited room; lack of awe-inspiring special effects was masked with more traditional skills, ie. use of light and sound, and going story first (everyone knows how annoying is the modern over-focus on CGI over human connection, even when the effects are great); and I have no reason to believe they were looking for cheap actors, but people with desire to go out and do their best and have some fun while at it.This film is fresh and entertaining, and as stated in the beginning, a great lesson in how to make something great out of nothing much.|"['All aspiring film-makers', 'films', 'SyFy', 'Asylum', 'note', 'we', 'characters', 'Characters', 'each their own voice', 'emotions', 'their personal past', 'what', 'them', 'them', 'them', 'It', 'a bit', 'the storytelling burden', 'the cinematography', 'these characters', 'the story', 'their part', 'a compelling story', 'Compelling', 'A story', 'events', 'an order', 'at least some kind', 'logic', 'it', 'Twists', 'turns', 'they', 'gimmicks', 'these engaging characters', 'something', 'Something', 'some weight', 'it', 'the viewer', 'the length', 'the movie', 'a bit', 'vision', 'A little quirk', 'the humanity', 'the characters', 'the story', 'the film', 'the valuable bond', 'the finished movie', ""its' audience"", 'we', 'none', 'these elements', 'a budget', 'a small budget', 'a constraint', 'a source', 'ingenuity', 'Monty Python', 'the Holy Grail', 'one excellent example', 'Attack', 'the Block', 'It', 'they', 'the money', 'a plethora', 'awesome locations', 'top-notch CGI', 'brand-name anything', 'what', 'they', 'what', 'they', 'a re- watch', 'The lack', 'locations', 'a brilliant and logical reason', 'limited room', 'lack', 'awe-inspiring special effects', 'more traditional skills', '. use', 'light', 'sound', 'story', 'everyone', 'the modern over-focus', 'CGI', 'human connection', 'the effects', 'I', 'no reason', 'they', 'cheap actors', 'people', 'desire', 'some fun', 'it', 'This film', 'the beginning', 'something', 'nothing']"

Cloud Atlas|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4724071/|10|Cloud Atlas may seem odd upon first glance, having the same actors/actresses play different characters but when I watched the trailer, I was intrigued. And then when it finally came onto Netflix, I ignored the mixed reviews and watched anyways.I. Loved. This. Movie.When this film ended, I had a smile on my face. People were complaining that the story was really hard to follow while for me, I found it kinda straightforward and easy to understand. This is six films wrapped into 1; A racial drama (1849) about the bond between a Black Stowaway (David Gyasi) and a Young Lawyer (Jim Sturgess), Another drama between a Gay Composer (Ben Whishaw) and a Greedy man (Jim Broadbent) who demands all the credit to himself for the piece that they have written together (1938), A Noir-Mystery about a reporter (Halle Berry) getting caught up in an Oil scandal (1973), A comedy-escape story about a writer (Jim Broadbent) being tricked into admitting himself into a nursing home run by a cruel nurse (Hugo Weaving) (2012), A Sci-Fi story about an Fabricant/android (Doona Bae), who is convinced to broadcast a manifesto by a rebel (Jim Sturgess), and a Post-Apocalyptic story about a tribesman (Tom Hanks) who helps a member (Halle Berry) of an advanced society reach a communication station to send an SOS to off-world humans. The acting was great and there are so many good actors/actresses in the movie that I can't mention them all. To make matters even crazier, they use the same actors/actresses in each timeline which was weird yet felt really cool, considerong this was a movie about decisions impacting the future. The makeup is so perfect that I didn't notice the other actors/actresses in their roles at one time. Visuals and Sound are great for a movie with a budget that is smaller than Alita: Battle Angel and the music is perfect for each story. And finally, the main message is very positive while the ending felt kind of uplifting. In short, this is one of the best movies I have seen if not, of all time.Is it worth a watch? YES. Ignore the reviews and watch the movie and you won't be disappointed by this epic tale. 10/10|['Cloud Atlas', 'first glance', 'the same actors', 'actresses', 'different characters', 'I', 'the trailer', 'I', 'it', 'Netflix', 'I', 'the mixed reviews', 'I.

Alien: Covenant|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3712841/|4|"After the amazing Alien and Aliens, (and I believe the hard done by Alien 3), we had a string of utter tripe from this franchise, and this is no better. Character development is almost non existent, with the vast majority of people there simply to die. Danny Mcbride might as well have had a leash on him, for all the acting he was allowed to do, and James Franco showed more charisma than anyone else in the movie...and he died before even having a speaking role.The film has gone down this ancient feel/setting, which didn't work in AVP, or Prometheus, and just flat out bores to death in this film. And the ""twist"" at the end was so obvious that there was an audible ""DUH"" and ""NO SH*T"" from onlookers in the cinema during the reveal.Ridley Scott's last two films have led me to believe a couple of things.1. He can't do jack without a GREAT script 2. His movies look good, but are boring as hell 3. Alien was a fluke! It was a mess of ideas that all came together and somehow worked, but that was by accident and not design...or at least not by Scott's design.Unless Cameron, or possibly Blomkamp (hell even give David Fincher another go) get involved, or perhaps someone equally as talented, we're just going to see Ridley Scott spew his old man, self indulgent philosophical man juice all over our faces for the foreseeable future It was an OK by film standards...but by an Alien film standards it was pure muck.And a final note.

Snowpiercer|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2992699/|1|No pacing, no decent dialogue, no characterisation, no decent action. No surprises. It's completely pointless and non-sensical.There are so many plot holes and impossibilities, even within the world of the initial premise, that right from the first line you understand that the only way you can get anything out of this stupidity is to follow along with the heavy-handed allegorical message. Unfortunately the film never waivers from the allegory even when you get the message after ten minutes. Still waiting for plot surprises? Sorry there won't be any. The only point in waiting for the end is just to see what happens. Trust me, if you having washing to do, do that instead. Spoiler Alert ! It's not worth finding out who lives, who dies and what happens to the kids.If you like allegories may I suggest Animal Farm, the Bible, the Matrix or the Wizard of Oz.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0204143/|9|"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks!  True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears.  It's perfect.  The end could not be better.  I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.  It's very effective.  Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man.  He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!).  Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant.  It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I.

Edge of Tomorrow|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3038374/|0|One of the most ingenious film concepts ever created, a cross between 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a gripping and clever blockbuster sci-fi thrill-ride accompanied with taut, fast-paced action and compelling direction. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed.

Equilibrium|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1036491/|10|"Set in a future, post-World War III society where emotions have been outlawed, Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), a government agent who begins to have doubts about the policy he is enforcing.Equilibrium is the perfect example why I do not rate lower for derivativeness or unoriginality. The film is basically high-concept combination of Fahrenheit 451 (1966), George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (original published in 1949, film versions appeared in 1954, 1956 and 1984), The Matrix (1999) and a bit of The Wizard of Oz (1939) thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are (assuming it's not a case of plagiarism), as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning, but how well the material is handled. The high-concept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly.On its surface, after a brief action-oriented beginning, Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film (meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed) to a thriller to a ""gun fu""-styled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writer/director Kurt Wimmer (who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him, including Sphere (1998) and The Recruit (2003)), with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth.The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff, which almost ""out-Matrixes"" The Matrix in style, if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat.Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogue-heavy, and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this (one of two) primary theme(s). Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior, but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion, and emotions are so wrapped-up with being sentient beings, it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them, and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through.Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's self-medication epidemic--even the title of the film seems to be a stab at the common claim that drugs like Prozac and Xanax are taken to help one ""smooth out"", or ""equalize"", extremes of mood, or extreme dispositions. The Equilibrium government extends this agenda into the tangible material realm as they also attempt to ""smooth out"" mood swings by eliminating any cultural artifacts that might promote varied moods/emotions. Wimmer seems to see it as a not-too-exaggerated extension of the modus operandi behind Prozac-like drugs.The other primary theme is one of institutional control. Wimmer has a lot to say about unquestioningly following authorities, and he's careful to show that it's not just governmental authorities that can be a problem. He does this by tightly wrapping religious allegory with his depiction of Equilibrium's government. The leader is known as ""Father"", and the government secret service members are ""clerics"". Those outside of this control are shown as authentic, free, individualistic and happy despite the hardships involved with their embrace of forbidden thought/items.More subtly, Wimmer employs the now overused washed out blue-gray cinematography of late 1990s/early 2000s genre films towards an unusual end. It's not just a stylistic device here, but represents a particular kind of reality. Under the purview of the fascistic government, blue-gray predominates. When glimpses of freedom/authenticity enter the film, the blue-gray look is gone, replaced with strongly saturated warm colors, and occasionally a more nostalgic subdued tone. This is one of the film's similarities to The Wizard of Oz, although maybe not the most significant one.If you're someone who cherishes originality for its own sake, you might not like Equilibrium as much, but you have much more serious epistemological problems to sort out. Otherwise, this is a film worth watching and thinking about."|"['a future, post-World War III society', 'emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'the story', 'John Preston', 'Christian Bale', 'a government agent', 'who', 'doubts', 'the policy', 'he', 'Equilibrium', 'the perfect example', 'I', 'derivativeness', 'unoriginality', 'The film', 'high-concept combination', 'Fahrenheit', 'film versions', 'The Matrix', 'a bit', 'The Wizard', 'Oz', 'good measure', 'What', 'the ideas', 'it', 'a case', 'plagiarism', 'something', 'an epistemological problem', 'us', 'our own familiarity', 'other material', 'the precedent status', 'the artwork', 'we', 'the material', 'The high-concept material', 'Equilibrium', 'its surface', 'a brief action-oriented beginning', 'Equilibrium', 'a progression', 'a fairly complex sci-fi film', 'it', 'a lot', 'exposition', 'speed', 'a thriller', 'a ""gun', 'fu""-styled actioner', 'The progression', 'writer/director Kurt Wimmer', 'who', 'the same level', 'elegant panache', 'other films', 'I', 'him', 'Sphere', 'The Recruit', 'the genres', 'the film', 'Wimmer', 'Equilibrium', 'a postmodernist automobile commercial', 'The transition', 'genre', 'The most impressive material', 'this surface level', 'the gun fu action stuff', 'style', 'Preston', 'an almost invincible opponent', 'His solitary misstep', 'a fighter', 'he', 'himself', 'emotion', 'the common advice', 'kung fu senseis', 'emotion', ""one's effectiveness"", 'combat', 'a big part', 'Equilibrium', 'the set', 'philosophical points', 'it', 'emotion', 'sections', 'the film', 'Wimmer', 'two) primary theme(s', 'dialogue', ""Wimmer's commentary"", ""man's emotions"", 'body language', 'behavior', 'Some viewers', 'it', 'a flaw', 'characters', 'what', 'they', 'signs', 'emotions', 'their comments', 'behavior', 'part', ""Wimmer's agenda"", 'it', 'just what', 'an emotion', 'emotions', 'sentient beings', 'it', 'them', 'it', 'The cast', 'an excellent job', 'characters', 'who', 'emotionless', 'cracks', 'the stoic armor', 'Wimmer', 'a harsh view', ""our society's self-medication epidemic"", 'even the title', 'the film', 'a stab', 'the common claim', 'drugs', 'Prozac', 'Xanax', 'extremes', 'mood', 'extreme dispositions', 'The Equilibrium government', 'this agenda', 'the tangible material realm', 'they', '"" mood swings', 'any cultural artifacts', 'varied moods/emotions', 'Wimmer', 'it', 'a not-too-exaggerated extension', 'the modus', 'Prozac-like drugs', 'The other primary theme', 'institutional control', 'Wimmer', 'a lot', 'authorities', 'he', 'it', 'governmental authorities', 'a problem', 'He', 'religious allegory', 'his depiction', ""Equilibrium's government"", 'The leader', 'Father', 'the government secret service members', 'clerics', 'this control', 'the hardships', 'their embrace', 'forbidden thought/items', 'Wimmer', 'blue-gray cinematography', 'late 1990s', 'early 2000s genre films', 'an unusual end', 'It', 'a stylistic device', 'a particular kind', 'reality', 'the purview', 'the fascistic government', 'glimpses', 'freedom/authenticity', 'the film', 'the blue-gray look', 'strongly saturated warm colors', ""the film's similarities"", 'The Wizard', 'Oz', 'you', 'someone', 'who', 'originality', 'its own sake', 'you', 'Equilibrium', 'you', 'much more serious epistemological problems', 'a film']"

The Hidden|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3077751/|9|There's very little I can say about 'The Hidden' which isn't gushing praise. When cult sci-fi films are being discussed, you always hear talk of 'Alien' or 'The Thing,' yet The Hidden never seems to get a mention. I always find that surprising as it's so good and yet so simple. No complex plots here - just an easy-to-follow bad alien being hunted down by a good alien.There's nothing much to say about it because it's just so much fun. If you like horror, action, or sci-fi, then you really should see this film. It has all of those elements, wrapped up in a simple plot with simple special effects and simplistic performances from its actors.Just sit back, grab the popcorn and enjoy.

The Manchurian Candidate|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5693605/|8|"In the remake of the 1964 thriller, Denzel Washington takes on Frank Sinatra's role as a war veteran drawn into a political web of destruction. The setting is moved to the current time, so instead of being a Korean war veteran, Denzel fought in the Gulf War. His fellow soldier, Liev Schreiber, comes from a political background and is seen as a front-runner for the upcoming election, thanks to his pushy and powerful mother Meryl Streep. While in the original, Angela Lansbury controlled her son, Laurence Harvey, to help her husband's political career, the remake gets another modern touch: Meryl herself is a senator, rather than a housewife.Meryl's performance in this movie is so chilling, it'll throw you for a greater loop than the story to find out she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award. Taking obvious inspiration from a certain powerful, ruthless female politician of the 1990s, Meryl embodies the bloodsucking, calculating, viscous character in her most realistic performance since The Bridges of Madison County.The wonderful thing about this story is it's obviously timeless. It was just as relevant and engrossing in 1964 as it was in 2004, and if another remake would be made in 2024, it would be just as well-received. Political power struggle is an unending game, and if you combine a mystery in the movie plot and cast a bundle of powerhouse actors, you've got a guaranteed box office smash. If you've never seen either version, look at the cast list and decide which one you want to start with. They're both very good, suspenseful, and well-acted, but you can only watch it for the first time once. Choose wisely-or Meryl Streep will yell at you.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During Denzel Washington's dreams, there are some zooms, swirls, and handheld camera movements that will make you sick.

Upstream Color|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2760733/|8|"UPSTREAM COLOR is already baffling the hell out of the world and will especially draw disapproval on IMDb.The plot is not delivered in a way that is traditionally comprehensible, only to those paying close attention to the themes that unite it all. If you're already rolling your eyes THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.If however you have experienced or would like to experience films where you have to dedicate your ability to assess and determine the underlying idea that is linking a series of enigmatic actions and subtle scenes, UPSTREAM COLOR will intrigue and probably charm you. It very much plays to the TREE OF LIFE crowd.For me, it's undoubtedly a massive artistic accomplishment. Hugely evocative and if you unearth those ideas, the ability to have human connection, abuse, hope and language among them, you'll have no problem following along and the ending will be very satisfying.If you want to say ""you're not supposed to understand it, just feel it"" that's fine. I think that if you stop and ask yourself what idea is driving moments, you can follow along just fine. The story is in the themes. Details are abstract to drive home this point.I took off two stars because I found the serious tone and sombre score to be so focused and constant, the atmospherics became a little more monotonous than I think was intended.

Chronicle|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2604151/|1|"Let me tell you, I hated ""Jumper"" for its total incoherence and lack of moral substance - and ended up watching this movie which might as well be titled ""Jumper 2""... It is simply insane that more and more directors/scriptwriters are jumping on the bandwagon, making more of those ""handheld style"" movies. How is something that is amateur and simply annoying e.g. playing with the zoom, swinging the camera around etc. supposed to be entertaining? Unfortunately, this is just one of the problems with this movie. The first 30 minutes we get to watch one of the characters filming around and explaining to everyone why is he doing so. That could have been cut down to 5 minutes and still served the same purpose i.e. who is who and why are they acting like that... but if the scriptwriters did so they would have to think of something to fill in the remaining 60 minutes. So after the boring beginning, out of nowhere, they learn about some noise coming from a cave nearby and just walk in. What was that object inside and how come nobody ever noticed it before? Too hard to explain so we are left wondering. Looking at the mysterious object turns out to be quite beneficial: for some reason the 3 characters gain cool superpowers that they manage to develop further simply by training so they can not only move Lego pieces around but even manage to learn how to fly (?!?) How telekinesis can be fashioned into flying is yet another mystery. Strangely, the one who is beaten up by an abusive father and cares a lot about his sick mother (Andrew) turns into an evil monster who never questions his actions - just because he considers himself a predator. From my point of view, this totally absurd development did not make any sense and is a complete script failure. The film obviously needed some action so I guess the scriptwriters figured ""Hey how about a cool battle between Andrew and Matt?"" Then all of a sudden Andrew is full of criminal energy and needs a few hundred bucks - so how about robbing some bullies and a gas station. No clue why he did not try robbing a bank with his superpowers and just toss around the bullies as pure act of revenge - let's assume he is not only turning evil but also a complete moron. Somehow the writers expect the audience to be morons too: instead of flying away after his heist, he prefers to run (?!?) Nice. Anyway, we get to a showdown with lots of explosions for their own sake - again, the evil kid might have just conveniently chosen to fly away instead of blowing up downtown Seattle but hey, he is evil, remember? So he has to get what he deserves and the audience gets the mandatory dose of good vs. bad fight.Basically, another letdown - if you take out the special effects, the remaining story would be totally useless. I expected the car accident that occurred earlier in the film and played such a pivotal role to lead to some interesting developments - but to my great surprise, it simply did not. Dead end, zero. Instead we got to see some extended flights through the clouds which served no specific purpose other than adding some screen time - which unfortunately only confirms my conclusion: story with a lot of potential but lacking imagination and depth."|"['me', 'you', 'I', '""Jumper', 'its total incoherence', 'lack', 'moral substance', 'this movie', '""Jumper', 'It', 'more and more directors/scriptwriters', 'the bandwagon', 'those ""handheld style"" movies', 'something', 'the zoom', 'the camera', 'the problems', 'this movie', 'The first 30 minutes', 'we', 'the characters', 'everyone', 'he', '5 minutes', 'the same purpose', 'who', 'who', 'they', 'the scriptwriters', 'they', 'something', 'the remaining 60 minutes', 'the boring beginning', 'they', 'some noise', 'a cave', 'What', 'that object', 'nobody', 'it', 'we', 'the mysterious object', 'some reason', 'the 3 characters', 'cool superpowers', 'they', 'they', 'Lego pieces', 'telekinesis', 'flying', 'another mystery', 'the one', 'who', 'an abusive father', 'his sick mother', 'Andrew', 'an evil monster', 'who', 'his actions', 'he', 'himself', 'my point', 'view', 'this totally absurd development', 'any sense', 'a complete script failure', 'The film', 'some action', 'I', 'the scriptwriters', 'a cool battle', 'Andrew', 'Matt', 'of a sudden Andrew', 'criminal energy', 'a few hundred bucks', 'some bullies', 'a gas station', 'No clue', 'he', 'a bank', 'his superpowers', 'the bullies', 'pure act', ""'s"", 'he', 'evil', 'the writers', 'the audience', 'morons', 'his heist', 'he', 'we', 'a showdown', 'lots', 'explosions', 'their own sake', 'the evil kid', 'downtown Seattle', 'he', 'he', 'what', 'he', 'the audience', 'the mandatory dose', 'good vs. bad fight', 'another letdown', 'you', 'the special effects', 'the remaining story', 'I', 'the car accident', 'the film', 'such a pivotal role', 'some interesting developments', 'my great surprise', 'it', 'Dead end', 'we', 'some extended flights', 'the clouds', 'no specific purpose', 'some screen time', 'my conclusion', 'story', 'a lot', 'potential but lacking imagination', 'depth']"

Coherence|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3101697/|6|"interesting and entertaining for me. have to admit that did not understand certain things, however, I had no desire to watch it again to find the answers.please see the movie first, as I doubt that comments would make sense....1. I think there was no enough motivation to resort to violence. 2. also, if the characters found out that interfering with another reality would destabilise the balance why would they carry on interfering, why they think that it would solve the problem, besides there is no real problem or threat, everything is based on theoretical propositions. In other words, I did not see enough evidence or necessity (even in their proposed theories) for them to think about threat or violence. In the end one of the characters tries to knock/pass out herself from another reality, which was at the initial phase, so I thought she wanted to guide others not to interfere or give some clues but later she resorts to even more violence, which does not make sense to me, as they did not have any realistic theory, which would imply that somehow the other selves from another realities would cause trouble. anyway how hurting/harming themselves would solve the ""problem"", not demonstrated.3. probably most of us would freak out in these kind of conditions but at least one of them should have been interested just to make a contact with him/herself - non of them was holding a gun or knife and non of them seemed a violent person, normal intelligent people, who I am sure would have acted differently in reality as there was no immediate or visible threat to their lives. 4. maybe there were all hallucinated by that drug, also I am sure there are more clues in the film than I noticed, especially about that drug near the end but as mentioned earlier could not watch second time. furthermore, there was a strange call right at the end, which suggests that it was not a hallucination.it is good that the story is open to interpretations but for me the actions pursued by the characters require more motivation and reasoning than shown in the movie...."|"['me', 'certain things', 'I', 'no desire', 'it', 'the answers.please', 'the movie', 'I', 'comments', 'sense', 'I', 'no enough motivation', 'violence', 'the characters', 'another reality', 'the balance', 'they', 'they', 'it', 'the problem', 'no real problem', 'threat', 'everything', 'theoretical propositions', 'other words', 'I', 'enough evidence', 'necessity', 'their proposed theories', 'them', 'threat', 'violence', 'the end', 'the characters', 'herself', 'another reality', 'the initial phase', 'I', 'she', 'others', 'some clues', 'she', 'even more violence', 'sense', 'me', 'they', 'any realistic theory', 'the other selves', 'another realities', 'trouble', 'themselves', 'the ""problem', 'demonstrated.3', 'us', 'these kind', 'conditions', 'them', 'a contact', 'him', 'herself - non', 'them', 'a gun', 'knife', 'non', 'them', 'a violent person', 'normal intelligent people', 'I', 'reality', 'no immediate or visible threat', 'their lives', 'that drug', 'I', 'more clues', 'the film', 'I', 'that drug', 'the end', 'a strange call', 'the end', 'it', 'a hallucination.it', 'the story', 'interpretations', 'me', 'the actions', 'the characters', 'more motivation', 'reasoning', 'the movie']"

There are no unreasonably loud sudden bangs, flashing screens, with screaming voices making you jump in your seat fumbling for your remote. This movie demonstrates how to build suspense without straining the viewer.The build up of the story is also untraditional; sometimes jumping back and forth without being confusing, and giving the viewer just enough information about what is ahead. Occasionally some characters breaks the fourth wall, justified through videotaped interviews subsequent to the main storyline: An instrument in storytelling I normally find cheapening, but here it finds it home.You will have time to wonder about life in the universe, space travel, and maybe even learn a thing or two.

Predator|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1051280/|10|"Some will tell you ""Predator"" is another dumb '80s action flick. It's not. It's very different from anything else Arnold Schwarzenegger has starred in. First of all it begins as a standard Military war film, setting up the plot for about 45 minutes! It then morphs into a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film: Like some sort of Agatha Christie novel meeting ""Rambo"" via ""Aliens."" It's quite intelligent and thrilling, not revealing the Predator creature fully until the very end. Part of the reason this film works, and the sequel does not (as successfully anyway), is the level of suspense and mystery surrounding the Predator.Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers one of his best performances as Dutch. Granted, he isn't required to do much more than shed his upper-body clothing and look ripped, but he _does_ do more than that - I felt sympathy for Dutch, he seemed like a realistic character, and I forgot that I was watching Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has a few good one-liners (""Stick around!"" being the cream of the crop along with ""Knock knock!"") but especially later in the film, his confidence stumbles and he turns into the flip-side of the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero.The sequel worked as a comic-book-style creature feature but the original ""Predator"" is a much better film than most people give it credit for, being the rare smart action film that is solidly constructed and worth watching far more than just once."|"['you', 'Predator', ""another dumb '80s action flick"", 'It', 'It', 'anything', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'it', 'a standard Military war film', 'the plot', 'about 45 minutes', 'It', 'a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film', 'some sort', 'Agatha Christie novel meeting', '""Rambo', 'Aliens', 'It', 'the Predator creature', 'the very end', 'Part', 'the reason', 'this film', 'the sequel', 'the level', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'the Predator', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'his best performances', 'he', 'his upper-body clothing', 'he', '_', 'I', 'sympathy', 'Dutch', 'he', 'a realistic character', 'I', 'I', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'He', 'a few good one-liners', 'the cream', 'the crop', 'Knock', 'the film', 'his confidence stumbles', 'he', 'the flip-side', 'the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero', 'The sequel', 'a comic-book-style creature feature', 'the original ""Predator', 'a much better film', 'most people', 'it', 'credit', 'the rare smart action film']"

Cube|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0490887/|10|SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking.

Demolition Man|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2562922/|10|"This has got to be one of the funniest action adventure films ever released. And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a ""pre-comic"" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it."|"['the funniest action adventure films', 'the beauty', 'it', 'the seriousness', 'the actors', 'their roles', 'Stallone', 'Snipes', 'two 20th century macho types', 'an Orwellian society', 'everything', 'the police', 'Bullock', 'a radical thinker', 'her perfect society', 'Leary', 'people', 'the people', 'who', 'they', 'part', 'the Perfect society', 'it', 'this film', 'the first shameless product promotion films', 'Taco Bell', 'the film', 'the only restaurant', 'the Franchise wars', 'I', 'it', 'a ""pre-comic"" movie', 'all the trimmings', 'bad guys', 'good guys', 'technological oddities', 'a lot', 'great lines', 'Worth seeing', 'a few lines', 'there and a couple', 'brief shots', 'nudity', 'you', 'Stallone', 'it', 'it']"

Super 8|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2441746/|8|The film is about a town mystery looked through the eyes of children. From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. The acting was very convincing and drawing although the movie suffers from its mediocre ending. A few times I felt that the logic and the flow of the plot were a bit unrealistic and artificial. I wish that the story was focused more on the mystery and the children's reactions without all the insignificant distractions and one-dimensional minor characters. After being disappointed by a series of recent movies, this one was refreshing and heart-fluttering. It flings us back to the adventure-seeking and truth-chasing time of our childhood. If you are into tantalizing sci-fi thrillers like this movie, I recommend 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' as your summer read.|"['The film', 'a town mystery', 'the eyes', 'children', 'the early part', 'the movie', 'you', 'something', 'you', 'any moment', 'Ever-multiplying questions', 'your brain', 'a suspense', 'the back', 'your mind', 'the end', 'the story', 'The acting', 'the movie', 'its mediocre ending', 'I', 'the logic', 'the flow', 'the plot', 'I', 'the story', 'the mystery', ""the children's reactions"", 'all the insignificant distractions', 'one-dimensional minor characters', 'a series', 'recent movies', 'this one', 'It', 'us', 'the adventure-seeking and truth-chasing time', 'our childhood', 'you', 'sci-fi thrillers', 'this movie', 'I', 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks']"

The ability of this film to pull emotions out of you is unlike most films we see today.As many of the users have said, this is a film made for children and it achieves this brilliantly.I do feel as well that it targets adults, returnign them to their innocence. The time of our lives when mothing was impossible and everything had goodness in it.  In modern times it is all too often seen that children are desperate to become adults and lose their innocence far too quickly. This story in which S.S developed helps adults to return to that time.I would give this film 11/10.

Soylent Green|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1290817/|6|"""Remember, before Star Wars, when sci-fi was smart?"" wrote one IMDb reviewer, apparently astounded at the intellectual merits of this film, the 1973 adaptation of Harry Harrison's novel, Soylent Green.I know, I'm supposed to be reviewing the film here too, but let me start off pointing out everything that's wrong with the above statement - sure, there were plenty of intelligent sci-fi films before Star Wars, like the original Solaris (1972), Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965) and Chris Marker's La Jetee (1962) amongst others, but it's not as if Star Wars set in motion an out-of-control train wreck of brainlessness.In fact, in the time since Star Wars, we've had Terry Gilliam's superb Jetee-inspired Twelve Monkeys (1995), The Matrix (1999 - the first one had plenty of brains) and Dark City (1998), to name only a few. Perhaps the argument might only be made that the genre took some time to recover from the action-oriented Star Wars, but the fact remains.The main flaw here is the idea that Soylent Green is a great example of an intelligent film. It's not. A dystopian look into the future and a bunch of unhappy humans does not necessarily turn a mediocre story into a great one, and nothing the film puts in place does anything to change that. Heston is his usual wooden, masculine posturing self, and the only bright sparks amongst the actors come from Edward G Robinson's last role as Sol, and the police inspector.The story is so well-trodden by now that it's essentially common knowledge, and it's not a horrible one. But the circumstances are obvious predictions to make if you have a pessimistic enough mind, and the ""surprise twist"" has nothing on that of the other famous Heston vehicle, Planet of the Apes.But the film soldiers on. There are good things about it - the moments of calm between Sol and Thorn are occasionally poignant - like when Thorn brings home rare foods - vegetables and even meat. Robinson's face tells a story that Heston couldn't approach in a million years. Affecting also is Sol's departure, staring up with wonder into an enormous television screen of fields and waterfalls.Unfortunately, things that could easily have been strengths are not acted upon. The film's sets are cheap and badly made - but where Godard, in the aforementioned Alphaville - used his limited sets and location shooting to enact a commentary on his modern day society, in Soylent it is a mere distraction from the story.For all its faults though, Soylent Green trots along at a fairly even kilter, and though its story provides little new (even, when one considers the amount of science-fiction literature around, in its time), it is occasionally thought provoking, and certainly still relevant - perhaps even more so - in these days of political unrest and global warming. Just don't get sucked into thinking Soylent Green is the bastion of science-fiction cinema, because it isn't even close."|"['Star Wars', 'sci-fi', 'the intellectual merits', 'this film', 'the 1973 adaptation', ""Harry Harrison's novel"", 'Soylent Green', 'I', 'I', 'the film', 'me', 'everything', 'the above statement', 'plenty', 'intelligent sci-fi films', 'Star Wars', 'the original Solaris', ""Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville"", ""Chris Marker's La Jetee"", 'others', 'it', 'Star Wars', 'motion', 'control', 'brainlessness', 'fact', 'the time', 'Star Wars', 'we', ""Terry Gilliam's superb"", 'Twelve Monkeys', 'The Matrix', 'the first one', 'plenty', 'brains', 'the argument', 'the genre', 'some time', 'the action-oriented Star Wars', 'the fact', 'The main flaw', 'the idea', 'Soylent Green', 'a great example', 'an intelligent film', 'It', 'A dystopian look', 'the future', 'a bunch', 'unhappy humans', 'a mediocre story', 'a great one', 'nothing', 'the film', 'place', 'anything', 'Heston', 'self', 'the only bright sparks', 'the actors', ""Edward G Robinson's last role"", 'Sol', 'the police inspector', 'The story', 'it', 'essentially common knowledge', 'it', 'a horrible one', 'the circumstances', 'obvious predictions', 'you', 'a pessimistic enough mind', 'the ""surprise twist', 'nothing', 'the other famous Heston vehicle', 'Planet', 'the Apes', 'But the film soldiers', 'good things', 'it', 'the moments', 'calm', 'Sol', 'Thorn', 'Thorn', 'rare foods', 'vegetables', 'even meat', ""Robinson's face"", 'a story', 'Heston', 'a million years', ""Sol's departure"", 'wonder', 'an enormous television screen', 'fields', 'waterfalls', 'things', 'strengths', ""The film's sets"", 'Godard', 'his limited sets', 'location shooting', 'a commentary', 'his modern day society', 'Soylent', 'it', 'a mere distraction', 'the story', 'all its faults', 'its story', 'one', 'the amount', 'science-fiction literature', 'its time', 'it', 'provoking', 'these days', 'political unrest', 'global warming', 'Soylent Green', 'the bastion', 'science-fiction cinema', 'it']"
Escape from New York|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0184530/|10|Although not as fast-paced or well-lit as its sequel, Escape from LA, this movie works on the level that it is futuristic, without being TOO futuristic, and the main character is likeable, while being tough at the same time.

Looper|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2679952/|8|Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations, Looper thunders onto the screen, showing, much like Inception did two years ago, that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it's done right.The film tells the story of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hit-man for an organised crime syndicate tasked with assassinating targets sent from the future. After being confronted with his future self (Bruce Willis) and failing to perform, Young Joe is forced to track down Old Joe and finish the job before being tracked down himself by the nefarious mob led by Abe (Jeff Daniels). However there is much more to the story than the basic premise, and Johnson isn't afraid to keep details close to his chest until later in the film than most movies of this type, so I won't spoil them here.While certainly paying subtle homage to its predecessors, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece, vastly superior to any of the higher profile action releases this year. While certainly made on a much larger playing field than Johnson's previous work (Brick, The Brothers Bloom), there is still a small-scale, independent feel to the film, and it benefits from clearly staying completely under the control of the young director. Delivering excitement sprinkled with thoughtful themes of personal sacrifice, he offers us much to chew on.Johnson understands that a successful action film doesn't need an explosion every ten minutes, and allows ample time for developing character and story, something which will likely divide audiences. Looper is very deliberately constructed, and after the highly charged opening establishing the intricate time-travel premise and direction of the plot, Johnson scales back the action almost too much as he ambitiously juggles the many and varied story elements he has created. Thankfully, any weakness in the middle of the film is largely overshadowed as Johnson launches the third act with such ferocity that the stark change of pace leaves you breathless.Despite the problems in the middle of the film, Looper overcomes its flaws purely by being that rare beast in Hollywood nowadays, the totally original script. Not an adaptation, not a sequel or remake, but a fresh idea from the mind of an immensely talented young film-maker. In a perfect world, Looper would be the game changer it deserves to be, slapping Hollywood studios across the face and announcing that not everything has to be a PG-13 franchise based on a comic book. It's unlikely that this will the case, and it remains to be seen whether or not the film will even be a success, but it's encouraging to see that there are young auteurs at work who are fighting to craft new and exciting stories, even if we only get to see the results every year or two.tinribs27.wordpress.com|"[""Rian Johnson's Looper"", 'parts', 'it', 'place', 'this years', 'crop', 'mostly underwhelming sequels', 'comic book adaptations', 'Looper thunders', 'the screen', 'Inception', 'a place', 'fresh material', 'it', 'it', 'The film', 'the story', 'Joe', '(Joseph Gordon-Levitt', 'a hit-man', 'an organised crime syndicate', 'assassinating targets', 'the future', 'his future self', '(Bruce Willis', 'Young Joe', 'Old Joe', 'the job', 'the nefarious mob', 'Abe', 'Jeff Daniels', 'the story', 'the basic premise', 'Johnson', 'details', 'his chest', 'the film', 'most movies', 'this type', 'I', 'them', 'subtle homage', 'its predecessors', 'Looper', 'a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece', 'the higher profile action releases', 'a much larger playing field', ""Johnson's previous work"", 'Brick', 'The Brothers Bloom', 'a small-scale, independent feel', 'the film', 'it', 'the control', 'the young director', 'excitement', 'thoughtful themes', 'personal sacrifice', 'he', 'us', 'Johnson', 'a successful action film', 'an explosion', 'ample time', 'character', 'story', 'audiences', 'Looper', 'the highly charged opening', 'the intricate time-travel premise', 'direction', 'the plot', 'Johnson', 'the action', 'he', 'the many and varied story elements', 'he', 'any weakness', 'the middle', 'the film', 'Johnson', 'the third act', 'such ferocity', 'the stark change', 'pace', 'you', 'the problems', 'the middle', 'the film', 'Looper', 'its flaws', 'that rare beast', 'Hollywood', 'the totally original script', 'Not an adaptation', 'a sequel', 'remake', 'a fresh idea', 'the mind', 'an immensely talented young film-maker', 'a perfect world', 'Looper', 'the game changer', 'it', 'Hollywood studios', 'the face', 'not everything', 'a PG-13 franchise', 'a comic book', 'It', 'the case', 'it', 'the film', 'a success', 'it', 'young auteurs', 'work', 'who', 'new and exciting stories', 'we', 'the results']"

Ex Machina|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3239686/|6|Ex Machina has a simple plot. Nathan, a reclusive programming genius, treats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava, an enigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow (or seduce) her visitor into believing she has human tendencies. Although this appears to be no real challenge, both Nathan and Caleb, the unlucky employee, egotistically assume they control the experiment. The rest is a foregone conclusion. As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese servant, style is no substitute for ideas. Where other films might explore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction. When not quoting philosophers or scientists, Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is the inventor of elaborate sex toys.

Even Christopher Ecclestone was awful in it, that should give you an idea just how bad this film is.Starting with some kind of bizarre alludes to anal probing (the game pod interface obviously intended to resemble this orifice) whereby Jennifer Jason Leigh seems to derive some strange pleasure from having her interface probed, and Jude Law being compelled to stick his tongue in hers, I was left wondering if this was going to turn into some kind of low rate virtual reality/cyber porn film. Unfortunately nothing as interesting as this was actually realised, and the film just slipped into a 'are we still in the game' convoluted B.S. as it transferred the players (and viewers) from one ridiculously unbelievable scene to the next.The game pods themselves were hysterically funny, and again alluded to some kind of sexual connection to the game playing, as they are animal in nature and have to have their 'nipple' tweaked in order to start the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh also at many times fondles and caresses her pod in a most unsettling way, almost making the viewer say the words 'get a room' Well i wish they had and the film could have ended there.Shame cos I like Jude Law but i have lost so much respect for him as an actor.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind|https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0152366/|1|"* 1/2 star out of ****Keep in mind Steven Spielberg is my all-time favorite director.  I love so many of his works, whether it's powerful drama (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Amistad) or fun escapist action films (the Indiana Jones films).  But with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, I was hugely dismayed by how dull, plodding, predictable, and outright stupid this film was. 
The fact is, the film contains so many annoying little flaws that all combine to bring the whole thing down.  Probably the most damaging aspect is the predictability of the story.  It takes 2 hours for the film to get to where I knew it was headed, and the resolution was most definitely not worth it.Richard Dreyfuss (who you'll probably confuse with Bob Balaban because of their similar looks), who is a decent actor in his own right, is disappointing as Roy Neary, whose character is so crazy and unlikeable, the experience of watching the film becomes numb.  The fact that he decides (spoiler) to leave his family behind to go with the aliens is unbelievable, nowhere near as convincing as Jodie Foster's and Gary Sinise's decisions to explore the stars in their respective sci-fi dramas, Contact and Mission to Mars, two vastly superior films.Close Encounters also suffers from some rhythmless pacing.  Everything moves slowly, and nothing really interesting occurs.  Granted, the finale is a visual treat, and the aliens do look realistic, but it's surprisingly dissatisfying.  There's nothing here truly worth watching.The script, written by Spielberg himself, isn't particularly compelling. The dialogue is a little weak, the character development misfires, and attempts to inspire a sense of awe are smothered by some really odd music from John Wiliams (a contrast to the brilliant scores of Alan Silvestri and Ennio Morricone in, once again, Contact and Mission to Mars).
