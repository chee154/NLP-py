Ad Astra,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5133705/,1,"Movie was just a drama flick....with so many unnecessary plots.
OK!!!.... So its space drama but at least get some science behind it. You don't fly around space with shield in ur hand like super hero... Overall terrible!!!!"
Alien,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6839468/,10,"When I see reviewers ratings less than five I have shake my head in disbelief. Alien set a standard that has yet to be equaled let alone surpassed. I watched it on the wide screen when it was first released, and over a dozen times since. And even though I know what's coming, the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up. What a brilliant work of theatrical genius."
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5412447/,10,"Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is! A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious. Up until a few years ago I didn't see most of the films and I didn't understand the hype now I do in which I'm happy with them all even seen the new ones."
12 Monkeys,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1151179/,9,"Normally I try to avoid Sci-Fi movies as much as I can, because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me. Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this ""Twelve Monkeys"" I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either. However, it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work. I give it a 9/10, maybe even a 9.5/10."
Dark City,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0412297/,10,"I will be part of the rabid throngs of people lining up to catch a spectacle as huge as Reloaded and Revolution. Despite(and maybe because of) Matrix sky high hype right now, my thoughts drift back to this overlooked classic...but a little on Neo and gang first below...The Matrix just happened.With an uncanny midas touch, The Warchowski bros launched this(then unknown film) at the the right place, in the right time. With an execution commercial enough to bring in the box office moola and a philosophical subtext accessible enough for the general public to latch on to, the rest, as they say...is history.The philosophical under pinnings though, (of blue pills, red pills, the subreality of consciousness and all that mambo jambo etc), so successfully popularised by The Matrix, was infact neither originated by  The Matrix nor as fully realised than in other more accomplished works.Which leads me to....drumroll.....As such, IMHO, the best execution on the concept of reality and perception was already explored in a much more unbelievably visual opus, one year earlier, the grossly overlooked, criminally under-rated,""Dark City"". (One of My Top 10 All time Favourite Films)This scifi/ film noir hybrid was impactful both cinematically and ideologically. Most importantly, it rewarded my wildly abandoned reach for human imagination and thirst for ideas, by fulfilling as much promise a motion picture can ever hope to give.On top of that, my background as a ""trekkie"" scifi nerd meant I instinctively respond to films which challenge me both intellectually and spiritually. Dark City was thus a near religious, life cleansing experience for me.And any which way I look at it, this film soars to heights unseen since 2001: A Space Odyssey...But due to its messed up(or near-absent) marketing campaign(positioning the film to resemble a horror film for the teenage crowd), the film did not find its intended audience and flopped unceremoniously. Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...That said, the thirst for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.And The Matrix filled that void.Too bad it wasn't this film. But in a ideal world, it would. Sad."
Mad Max: Fury Road,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3239211/,10,"Yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80% practical effects and that's a fact on this web page so you're completely wrong when you say that it's full of cgi. But anyway this movie is a real crazy ride. From the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. This man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together. He managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now. This is the best pure action movie that I've ever seen."
Arrival,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3561769/,10,"ARRIVAL delivers on so many levels it's impossible to describe without spoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you see a film, read, ""The Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang...but I highly recommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a warm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking film you'll long remember. One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.The special effects team delivered, too. Amy Adams performance was stunning. Sci-fi is largely disregarded when awards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams work in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscar-worthy for a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise Banks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for Florence Foster Jenkins. It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were well worth the work. Ten well-deserved stars for ARRIVAL. I wish it a huge success at the box office so this team will continue to make more films of this caliber."
2001: A Space Odyssey,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2062864/,1,"This is certainly one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen in my life. I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels ""the dawn of mankind"", near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be ""interpreted"" by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making."
Total Recall,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6878311/,8,"Total Recall questions who we truly are. Are we defined by our pasts? Our ideals? Our relationships?No, what we are is a triple agent undercover spy working for ""the agency"" but actually working for a rebel uprising on Mars but we've never been to Mars, or have we?More seriously, this movie is full of many genuinely surprising and confusing moments, keeping the watcher on edge. It's got Schwarzenegger comedy and acting, and very unique sci-fi Martian sets that give it a unique feel."
Blade Runner,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5640220/,10,"Even before the plot kicks in, Blade Runner's strangely beautiful neon sci-fi images make this an instant masterpiece. Blade Runner's philosophical plot aligns with it's appealing visuals focusing on how even the smallest things in life are fascinating. Even the most fantastic imagery comes from some of the most basic things, such as smoke from a cigarette glimmering in sunlight. In Blade Runner, Earth has become numb to such a dazzling gift life is, which allows a deeper exploration through Harrison Ford's well preformed slowly realizing Rick Deckard and Rutger Bauer's Roy Batty. It may take a little bit to realize if you lose focus, but Blade Runner is a grimly majestic film that will make you appreciate the little things in life."
Gattaca,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2908273/,9,"I watched ""Gattaca"" earlier when it came out, but I was probably too young and/or drunk to appreciate it at the time. So I got the blu-ray and watched it again.What a quality film this is. Nevermind that the budget wasn't big, everything is handled with care. Cinematography is top notch, the script is coherent and clever at the same time, the music is absolutely beautiful, actors do a fine job, the directing of Niccol keeps everything in check. I can't find significant flaws in this movie.This is not what people usually expect from SciFi movies today. This is not an action film in space. ""Gattaca"" is a science fiction movie as much as it is a drama with a little detective story hidden inside. Almost nothing is ""in your face"", since this movie doesn't make a huge deal out of every meaningful scene. It's not trying to force you to feel or think anything, so the emotional reaction I got was only after the movie had ended. Only then it hit me, and it hit me hard. And the music (I have to compliment the score once again) played inside my head for quite some time.The above is the main reason I appreciate this film a lot. Many will dislike it for the same reason. If you want something huge, something with immediate impact, something which is trying to impress you, there's a chance you won't love this movie. I too admit that I would've wanted the story to be more gripping and intense, but then again that certain subtlety is one of the strengths of this film. Nevertheless, I recommend ""Gattaca"" to everyone. When you're in a calm, ponderous or thoughtful state of mind, watch this.Gattaca asks you important questions without forcing an ambiguous, open ending. Niccol wrote and directed a quality movie and he will be remembered for it. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Xander Berkeley and Alan Arkin were convincing in their roles, and every actor did a fine job.""Gattaca"" is a thoughtful, humane story and a genuinely well-made film. It already survived the test of time this far, and it will continue to do so. Even if it seems a bit underwhelming, there's a lot of love in it."
The Terminator,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6103462/,9,"This is a perfect film. Science fiction, action, compelling story, memorable story, pretty woman and humanity.
Amazing that the special effects stand up to this day and it has been 35 years or so.
I wish they would stop with all the sequels and franchise making."
Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1107394/,8,"After the enormous success of ""Mad Max"" in 1979, it was predictable that a sequel would follow. In fact, two sequels followed, and the first of these is ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"".Released in the U.S. simply as ""The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max 2"" begins with a narration re-introducing us to wandering ex-cop Max (Gibson) ... and then we're off. In post-apocalyptic Australia, Max wanders the nuclear waste lands in search of Earth's most precious resource: gasoline. When he discovers a band of people guarding a large deposit of fuel, he lends his services as a driver to help them escape from a vicious group of bandits intent on taking the gas for themselves.""Mad Max 2"" is one of the best sequels ever. It's everything the original was and more. Mel Gibson is great, and the cast performs very well. Brian May's skills as a composer have improved, and he gives a very fast-paced score. George Miller's directing skills have also improved, and he deals us out some intense car sequences that have yet to be rivaled.This film is special because, although it was very popular when released and is even more popular now, it is unique in that it is not afraid to be just that. If that confused you, let me put it this way: George Miller has created a film that, while trying to improve the flaws from past films, is not afraid to be original and un-Hollywood. And I must say, Mr. Miller pulls it off excellently.I love ""The Road Warrior"" as well as the rest of the ""Mad Max"" series. I would say that ""Mad Max 2"" is quite possibly the greatest film to come out of Australia. It is one of Mel Gibson's best and one of the best sci-fi films ever. ""Mad Max 2"" is essential."
Moon,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2079904/,7,"Originally posted to titsandgore.com, April 2009:Moon is an auspicious debut from Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie), a talented new director who happens to be the son of David Bowie (let me officially be the first person to predict that every review of this film in the mainstream press will have the tagline ""SPACE ODDITY!""). Sam Rockwell gives a truly remarkable performance as Sam Bell, a lunar miner who is nearing the end of his 3-year contract at a single-man mining outpost. His only companion is the station computer, Gertie, a straight-up HAL homage that tantalizingly suggests how a culture informed by decades of watching 2001 might choose to design a companion robot.To say too much more about the plot would be to spoil its central conceit, and while I'm sure many reviewers will talk openly about it, I want to preserve the surprise if at all possible at least until the film gets its theatrical release this coming June.Suffice it to say that Jones admirably mixes together stock genre tropes, paying tribute to a number of classic science fiction features while retaining his own idiosyncratically dark vision. Familiar filmic concepts of the ""clean future"" and the ""dirty future"" are mixed together to create a unique atmosphere; the milieu is suitably claustrophobic, the cramped quarters of the mining station serving the film's conceptual purposes while masking the shoestring budget. In fact, it may be hard to spare a glance at the meticulously designed sets with your eyes glued to Rockwell for the duration of the picture. His performance is utterly mesmerizing, inhabiting the role so completely that it is impossible to imagine any other actor having the chutzpah to pull it off.Which is not to say that Moon is without its problems; the pacing is hardly consistent and Jones' reliance on Rockwell tends to undersell his direction. Parts of the film veer dangerously close to identical thematic elements in Steven Soderbergh's recent adaptation of Solaris, without being as emotionally potent. But what it lacks in originality is mostly compensated for by the sheer audacity of its central performance and the careful economy of its direction.Moon may be dressed in familiar clothing, but it is a singular experience, a clever, darkly funny and genuinely moving journey into the nature of individuality. Jones is already at work on a second science fiction feature, and it is welcome indeed to see such a promising new talent continue to develop his voice by working in genre film-making!"
Aliens,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5428447/,10,Siqourney Weaver at the peak of her acting career. Its very rare to see a sequel surpass all expectations. The movie does a great job at making you feel the tension at critical moments. They also manage to advance the plot in a good direction that makes sense.possibly the best sequel ever made.
Upgrade,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4209356/,10,"Went in thinking this was going to be a good action movie with some fun AI-inspired fight scenes, but it was so much more than that. All of the actors, almost all unknown, were phenomenal, and the writing and pacing was perfect. The dynamic between the AI and the main character was somehow both funny and terrifying as it slowly digressed. Man what an awesome movie. Will be recommending to everyone."
The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4637987/,10,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film."
District 9,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2110672/,9,"Everyone's seen the trailer that kick-started one very fishy-looking viral campaign, interviewing several humans and an alien in quick succession. That marks many people's first exposure to Neill Blomkamp's District 9, and the trailer - which had a decently executed ""mockumentary"" feel to it, which only served to make its sci-fi content seem even more surprising. This same element of surprise is still present throughout the film proper, and it is quite a cinematic treat.District 9 takes place in an alternate timeline where, twenty years ago, an alien spaceship came to a halt above the city of Johannesburg. The inhabitants of the ship are unable to operate the ship anymore, so they end up being segregrated to their own slum within the city below. Eventually, the government calls for the eviction of the aliens (nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their appearance) from the slum. The film's ostensible protagonist is Wikus (Sharlto Copley), who through a series of events too complicated to recount in a synopsis, ends up undergoing some rather dramatic changes and before long he's thrust into the middle of something far too big for him to handle...The best thing about District 9 is that it always manages to stay fresh and surprising throughout. As the trailers indicate, it starts off as a mockumentary in order to expose the gist of the story. The film gradually crosses over to being a more conventional film, although still filmed with a very documentarian look and interspersed with occasional news footage or interviews. Despite the unexpected change in presentation, you don't really notice because you're so wrapped up in the ingenious premise. Then you're presented with the plight of Wikus, whose story is one I don't really want to expose too much because watching it all unfold was just amazing to watch. He's a perfect example of the Everyman, trying to survive as best he can in the face of everything that the world throws at him over the course of the film. His development, along with that Chris, the prawn he befriends (who is surprisingly well-rounded for a CGI character) raises this above your average science-fiction film. Even when the film's final third act becomes incredibly action-packed, it still doesn't jar with the mood of the film and doesn't forsake its characters and intelligence for the sake of cheap action sequences.On that subject, the action sequences are far from ""cheap"". Given that Blomkamp and collaborator Peter Jackson were originally aiming to make a film adaptation of Halo before changing to this, there's still plenty of moments that feel quite reminiscent of Bungie's game, from the alien technology to the frantic battles. The effects work looks great in even the simplest of situations, to say nothing of the bombastic finale. There's just something about the way it all comes together, especially when it is combined with one very uncompromising storyline and subject.District 9 is a rare find nowadays. It doesn't sacrifice the intelligence or raw power that its story affords it for the sake of appeasing your ""typical"" blockbuster crowd with a lighter rating and less focus on the story. It's a damned fine thriller that is not without its flaws, but is still several cuts above your average summer film and is well worth watching - but only if you can handle the heat. And it does get quite hot."
Annihilation,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4104382/,10,"I don't review films, but I felt I had to counter the ""one star"" ratings from people who evidently didn't ""get"" this modern sci-fi masterpiece. I have to say I'm baffled by the extremely low reviews from some people, especially those who claim they went to sleep during the movie (is it fair to give it one star if you didn't see all of it?), or those who claim they are doing it to counter the ""fake"" ten star reviews. I am giving this a ten because this movie single-handedly restored my faith in cinema as capable of giving me an ""experience"" in the theater. This is not a perfect film. That's not why I gave it a ten. I gave it a ten because of its vision and its impact. I'd say it's a cross between Alien, Arrival, Monsters, and 2001. If you don't like films that create an environment and put you in it to experience something, you probably won't like this. It's not a straight linear sci-fi film where you will have all your questions answered. Instead, it will make you think about what life and death is, about what ties us together, and it will give you a few scares along the way, and show you things you have never seen in other films. It will also convey how important the soundtrack can be in a film.It's tragic that other countries didn't get a chance to see this in the theater. For anyone watching this overseas on Netflix, I recommend you watch on the largest television you can find with the best sound system you can get, and crank it. If you have to bribe your friend with the 70"" television and Atmos sound system, do it. It's worth it to experience this film to the fullest. I wish I could see it for the first time again in the theater.If you've read the book, Garland says this was created as a sort of ""dream"" of the book, and it's only roughly based on that work. If you have read the book first, you need to reset your expectations going in.Again, this is not a ""paid"" review, it's not a ""fake"" review. I experienced what I can only describe as a near-religious experience in the theater watching this film, and a repeated view at home brought all those feelings back. It's a tremendous work, and I can't wait to see what Garland does next."
Blade Runner 2049,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw7044819/,3,"The original had the best soundtrack ever. This one? Well, if you like electronic farts... At least, they wake you up every time they go off.Sequels = zzz."
Donnie Darko,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1308942/,9,"This is an intriguing film with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the title role. Is Donnie Darko slowing going mad, is the weird giant rabbit a friend or an enemy, and is there something sinister going on? The story unravels and you get drawn into the strange world of Donnie Darko and his journey which reached an inevitable, melancholy but strangely satisfying conclusion.I won't say much about the plot, but you might need to have a second look to understand exactly what is happening. Only one thing needed to be said - if you ever want to watch this film, watch the original version, avoid the Director's cut version. The director's cut added unnecessary scenes and pointless graphics which, although perhaps the director thought might think help explain the movie better, is a big mistake. The original version is mysterious and all the better for it, and if you don't understand it completely, it matters not a jot. In fact it is silly to try to make sense of the science as some tried to do because it is hardly the point of the film, and in any case Hollywood simply can't do science well in most of its films. Just enjoy an intriguing journey through the mind of a disturbed (or may be not) teenager."
The Cabin in the Woods,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2613186/,1,"I am writing this review to help those who fall into the trap of seeing a rating of 7.9 and thinking this film must have some redeeming qualities. Believe me it doesn't. It is ridiculous and abysmal. The scary thing is the sort of individual that enjoys this film is the same individual that states scream is original. Some may find this deeply disturbing but I would be quite happy to live in a world without films such as scream, there i said it. There was only one scene that I found funny and it was when Mr athlete decided to ride his bike into a force field of some sort. I began thinking something worth while was going to happen but this moment never came."
Interstellar,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3215295/,10,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
Unbreakable,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4250247/,10,"This movie should be released today. In the era of CGI superheroes with no story or character arc, this is a realistic view of superhero genere. Bruce Wills, I never thought I would say this, is awesome. Samuel Jackson is fantastic, I don't know why he chose to be one eye guy in Marvel movies, he is mire capable actor than this. Manoj Shayamalan is a truly great film maker. Robin Wright is very good. Overall a great superhero movie, a must watch."
Primer,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2104008/,1,"How I wanted to enjoy this movie. This movie ""makes you think""? Maybe if you're a twentysomething, sick of the Hollywood crap out there, but not really educated enough in classic science fiction to recognize when someone is recycling old paradoxes, and not mature enough to require character development from the figures on the screen. For the rest of us, it does not matter how much the filmmaker supposedly ""captures the atmosphere"" of engineers who speak in monotone. As Sontag said, the audience should not be called upon to react as if what is happening in fiction is actually happening in real life. (If I make a boring film in which people really go to the bathroom, is that brilliant as well?) The cinema verite style here does not work and is not appropriate, and despite the barrage of early 10-star reviews - obviously planted by cheerleaders connected with this project - that signals a failure by the filmmaker to engage his audience, which is, yes, his job. Smugness about how people ""don't get it"" is not film criticism - at any rate, we do get it, because the story is paper-thin. Show, don't tell - give us action (and I do not mean superficial action as in ""Independence Day""), not relentless unemotional dialog that appeals to young, largely male, geeks. (All of the important male characters here are married, with kids - what irony!) Film, like any other art, is communication, and while this film has potential, that makes the inept execution of it all the more disappointing. Actually, I would recommend that people see it, with the caveats that I've given above, because it is an example of a good idea; however, in no way does this film deserve such effusive, histronic praise. Oh, and incidentally - electrical current is measured in amperes, not in ""volts."" (Volts measure voltage, duh.) So much for the snobbish techno-wow jargon by these so-called engineers at the beginning!"
They Live,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5573631/,8,"This is another film I'm giving more stars to than it probably deserves because of a childhood fondness for it. For whatever reason, this film made an impression on me and always stuck in my memory. Despite the limited acting ability of professional wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper in the lead, the idea of aliens secretly taking over and subliminally lulling the populace into complacency (through TV, media, consumerism, and other distractions), the story remains interesting and relevant today (i.e. more screens, more apps, more distractions). A prescient film if there ever was one. Writer/director John Carpenter made this film in the 1980s Regan Era, but in the age of the 1%, the decline of the middle class, and police shootings, this film surprised me how relevant it is today and even more so than when it came out. Roddy Piper plays an out of work construction worker who discovers an alien race has secretly taken over the government, media, and the business world and have perpetrated a subliminal campaign to keep the masses asleep and in their place. When Piper discover specially designed sunglasses that allow him to see his world plastered with subliminal messages telling the masses to ""SLEEP"" ""OBEY"" ""CONSUME"" ""WATCH TV"" ""DO NOT QUESTION AUTHORITY"" ""MARRY AND REPRODUCE"" or ""THIS IS YOUR GOD"" printed on money. In this film, billboards and television are the main modes of conveying this message, but imagine how much easier it is to placate the masses in the internet age with smart phones, tables and laptops in the hands of most every citizen. Thematically, this film is Carpenter's most overtly political film. In terms of storytelling and tone, Carpenter has always had something of a throwback style and this film, although thematically serious and fairly grim at times, actually reminded me of the corny sci-fi films of the 50s and 60s. However, it works. One the spectrum of corny sci-fi, this is not goofy sci-fi for kids, like ""Invaders from Mars,"" but I would liken it to scrappy politically subversive science fiction films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" That film took on McCarthyism and Carptener's film is taking on the 1%. There are a number of Carpenter regulars in the film including Keith David, George ""Buck"" Flower, Peter Jason, and Al Leogn in an uncredited bit part. You also get Meg Foster and Sy Richardson so it's a solid cast. Overall, ""They Live"" is smart social commentary, even if it's told with a lot of hokum (and I'm not even going to get into epic fist fight between Piper and Keith David, which alone make the film worth watching)."
The Martian,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6512384/,9,"This is a great sci-fi movie that's realistic enough to not be weighed down by being unrealistic or ridiculous in that way.The acting and plot are great. The story is engaging, and Matt Damon does a great job in playing a character that everyone is trying to save (he always seems to be playing a character that everyone is trying to save or everyone is trying to kill)
One thing that I do think weighs this movie down, and why it's a 9/10 and not a 10/10, is all the swearing. I can understand some swearing here and there, but it does get to a point in the Martian that the swearing feels gratuitous and can detract a bit to a lot from the viewing experience depending on how much you do or don't mind swearing in movies.
Other than that I'd say the movie is fairly accurate to the book, and it's extremely well done, and is a definite must watch if you like it when movies at least try to put a good effort into being as realistic as possible.9/10 would recommend."
10 Cloverfield Lane,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6351437/,6,It would have been solid 8 or 9 if it wasn't for the ending. Except that it was quite an intense mystery.
Dredd,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2670068/,10,"I'm a huge fan of the comic 2000AD and the character Judge Dredd since 1979, and this film completely satisfied me. They changed all the right things and kept all the right things. Director Pete Travis tackled the problem of filming a comic book by making something that looks nothing like a comic book and more like an action movie shot on location, with a simple linear plot that keeps rolling and never slows down.Megacity 1 is made markedly less futuristic than the comic in order to become so believable that it is hard to tell where the real slums of Cape Town end and the CGI kilometre high city blocks start. I have an uncomfortable feeling that in less than a hundred years cities like this may actually exist.The comic Judge's uniform works on paper but can't in real life - giant golden eagles, shoulder pads and bronze name badges hanging off a leather one-piece body suit would sag, wobble and look daft. The movie gives us body armour that looks like it actually gets used whilst keeping the helmet exactly the same. The effect is striking and believable, like everything else in this film.The plot revolves around a drug which makes time seem to slow down a hundred times, the perfect excuse for scenes of ultra slo-mo explosive bloody (and beautiful) anatomically correct violence that earn this film its 18 rating. Not a kid's movie at all. Every supporting actor looks like they came out of a gang documentary, scarred, nasty, sweaty and mean. Lena Headey totally kicks ass as the ruthless gang lord Ma Ma, calmly relishing the deaths of her enemies, eyes sledging from narcotic addiction.In a way this is Olivia Thirlby's movie, since she gets the character arc, rookie judge Cassandra Anderson assigned to Dredd for evaluation and finding herself on a very steep learning curve. She is vulnerable, spikey and tough as called for, vital to the movie in order to balance Dredd.How do you play Dredd? He is the opposite of a character. He has no personal arc, never changes or grows. He has no sense of humour, the comic finds that by placing utterly deadpan 'ol stony- face in ironic situations that reflect off him. And where do you find an actor prepared to wear a helmet obscuring everything but his mouth and chin for the whole 95 minutes? Karl Urban must be a huge fan himself to play the part so right. One reviewer described his performance as ""ego-free"" and it is. I didn't see Urban anywhere in this movie, all I saw was Dredd.Me and Dredd-heads everywhere thank you Karl. You smashed it."
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0980979/,10,"Here's the basic plot. Clemintine and Joel have a long, rocky relationship. Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure. Now here's what I thought about it. This movie is completely amazing. Totally original story and wonderful directing. Some of the best directing that i've seen in any movie. Some of the best original music too. This is in my top five favorites, and it also boosted Jim Carrey into one of my favorite actors. You know you have a good movie on your hands when the next day you're still thinking about parts of it, and you want to see those parts again. If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you check it out. It's different, in a really good way. There's not much more to tell you about it. If you want to see the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey, than you should absolutely skip this one. But if you want to see a side of him and Kate Winslet that you've never seen, or if you want to see a total original movie with wonderful cinematography and really great music, then by all means, you should absolutely see this one!"
Back to the Future,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3056368/,10,"One of the best movies EVER! Back the The Future is movie on time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. I've watched this and About Time which are movies about time traveling and both are awesome. BTTF is TOO Awesome. Couldn't believe this was a 1980s movie.BTTF trilogy is an incredibly awesome adventure taken by Marty McFly and Dr.Emmett Brown. Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level... It's a MUST WATCH for all.Hope you all enjoy it too. Cheers!"
A Clockwork Orange,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5304387/,9,And some ultraviolence too.Is this the world's most stylish and interesting and amazing movie?
Children of Men,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1506361/,8,"this film is one of the best things i have seen this year. It's an improbable cross between ""Brazil"" ""a clockwork orange"" and the video game HALF-LIFE2 (from which it borrows it's final sequences and use of on shot action-sequences) it manages to be both entertaining in the Hollywood way (with incredible action sequences and a very clever way of using digital effects) yet very sad and different with a very very dark and realistic overtone. No comic relief, no cartoon character bravery, only human behavior in it's best and most horrible way. This realistic overtone makes the main characters very engaging and moving. CLive owen (whose i have always disliked) is excellent as the man drowned into an adventure too big for him (sorry for my bad English)It's the same kind of film than V for vendetta (both taking place in a futuristic fascist British society) different from the usual mainstrean studio teenager pleaser crapGO see it! help intelligent cinema"
The Truman Show,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2670331/,8,"I sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a TV show, I see this movie and i quit the wonder.The Truman Show was written by Andrew Niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of The Twilight Zone called ""Special Service"".After the script had gone through some re-writes, Jim Carrey was picked for the role, although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shooting.Made with a budget of over $ 60 million dollars, The Truman Show was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the Academy Awards, but did not win any awards.The movie tells the tale of an Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who lived his entire life, since before birth, in front of cameras for The Truman Show.Unaware of this fact, Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world, allowing executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writers.The thrill about Truman's life is that everything is arranged for him, down to the woman he married to his best friend.The movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make Truman do some particular things.The script and the movie lines are fun, especially when the Actors had to advertise on the show. The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show. Andrew Niccol went ahead to do more great movies from S1m0ne with Al pacino in 2002 to The Terminal with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in 2004."
Rise of the Planet of the Apes,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2469283/,9,"Of all the movies that can possibly be re-booted......why reboot another movie that's already been re-booted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one? Well it must be the script, because everyone that's come across it has wanted to be somewhat involved. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don't think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton's version.Finally......a summer movie that's actually WORTH your summer dollar. Almost every element of this film is pitch perfect. Just what makes this 'oh so' great? Allow me to explain....Judging from the preview, i thought the movie to be a little too relative to the concept from ""Deep Blue Sea"". But this movie takes a much more different route with their Alzheimer's approach. Needless to say, they did a much better job than that movie.....obviously.I know most people may be scratching their heads to this comment, but in my opinion, this is easily the most well written script of the year thus far. It's intelligent, thought provoking, emotional, and damn well entertaining. What makes this so good is the progression of the main ape 'Ceaser' (heh, ironic name), and his journey from a curious and smart ape, into an upset ape that realizes the harsh realities of being treated like an animal. It's now easy to see just why everyone jumped on board when they read this. I kid you not, i actually got goosebumps from this movie, and that rarely happens.And once again, the Weta team did a phenomenal job with their brilliant special effects. Andy Serkis who has already done work like this before in 'Lord of Rings' and 'King Kong', out preformed most actors in Hollywood without barely saying a word. Is it wrong to say that a man in a blue suit with dots all over him, imitating an ape is so far the best actor i've seen this year? Uh.....not at all. Trust me, see the movie, and you'll understand why.Bottom Line.......not only is this easily the best movie of the summer, i will go as far as saying it's the best movie i have seen so far this year. Yes, it is THAT good. Like i said earlier, almost every element of this movie is pitch perfect. The writing, the acting, the special effects.....all done to near perfection. It some people's eyes, this is called a reboot. However, it feels more like a prequel. But judging from what i just saw, i hope to god that they make more of these, because it literally just blew my mind."
The Matrix,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4125407/,10,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."
Sunshine,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2810959/,3,"OK - the space effects and such looked cool. The ships looked cool. It had nice special effects. The human drama issues and moral quandaries were reasonable issues to bring up. Yet many of the story twists and complications (actually most of them) were um...""borrowed"" (I say it kindly) from other movies (far too common these days) - with pieces of technology taken from everything from ""Event Horizon"" & ""Dr Who"" to ""The Abyss"".BUT - the most important failure here is - science fiction -MUST- have science in it, at least speculative science, or the whole thing dies. The science in this movie is beyond bad. Even the ""Star Wars"" saga, with space ships that cornered in a vacuum just like airplanes do in an atmosphere, had a better grasp of science than these people did.This movie was woefully lacking in basic science. It was done with no understanding of even the most basic physical laws. They were trying to rescue the planet earth by saving our sun...fixing a problem that cannot happen, with methods that could not work.HOW DO SUNS WORKThe sun does not act the way this movie shows us. Suns function due to a vast quantity of atoms pressing inward due to GRAVITY. Our sun is not going to stop working in another 50 years. It will be chugging along, long after we (humanity) has long been extinct. Their entire premise for how to reignite a sun is beyond stupid (since it is not a fire anyway). A sun is a STAR - a massive fusion reaction. To get it to keep going (should it fail) you would need one of two things:1) hydrogen (and far more than any group of humans could ever amass) to fix the problem. 2) or a way to turn the other elements in that sun, back into the hydrogen that it all used to beAlso a sun dies when the elements that are in it (starting out as hydrogen) have fused into heavier and heavier elements and then into far too much iron. Then you have troubles (several billions of years from now).NOT ENOUGH OXYGENHumans (when our cells work) produce water due to our normal animal biology. Yes we do also exhale CO2, but that is very easy to scrub. We do it today just fine. On a space ship, the biggest problem is getting rid of the WATER which accumulates everywhere (we breathe it out and we sweat it out of us). It has to be removed from the air. Also, water is H2O - part oxygen and part hydrogen and a whole lot of kids have split off that oxygen in science class - back down into hydrogen and oxygen. How come they did not know how to do this?Remember all of those wet locations in the ship in Alien? That was far more realistic.Also why did they use big plants to scrub their air, instead of just using algae inside of transparent plates - which grows far faster and makes far more O2 per surface area? That is how our planet got so much free oxygen. It makes way more sense than big plants do? I suppose that that was not pretty enough for them.ALSO - when they did lose their CO2 scrubbing plants, it would not have mattered at all to their mission. Why? It would have taken a very long time for that few humans to use up the amount of oxygen in a ship of that size. The ship was massive. Exactly how much oxygen per day do 4 to 6 people need to survive? How they could have not had enough oxygen to make it to the sun when they were right next to it (half a day just by gravity)? They were close enough that is caused their ship harm. They needed special shielding. The volume of that huge ship was filled with AIR (not vacuum). Even after all their various problems, that thing was so HUGE they could have lived on the air in it for many months without any noticeable build-up of carbon dioxide.But let us pretend otherwise and depart from reality for a second. *WHY* do we have a scene in which one of the crew so very happy to find one tiny living plant spout growing in the remains of their ships oxygen scrubbing system? Why? It would have taken many years to grow enough plants to make a scrubber for a ship that large (large enough for far more people than were on it).First they are sad due to the death of their plants, which they do not need given that the energy from the sun was more than enough to run old fashioned non-plant CO2 scrubbers (as used by NASA now) and as they were HEADED FOR THE SUN they would have had lots of solar power.So, why build a forest in the ship for atmosphere scrubbing, if it is not ever leaving the solar system? Somebody must have thought it was pretty. Perhaps they saw it in another movie or TV show.STUPID SCIENCE KILLED THE SHOW FOR ME Stupid science destroyed the movie. Anyone who passed high school basic science (in fact most 6th grade science classes teach the needed pieces) could have given them better ideas than the ones they used. Next time, when doing science fiction, get a person on your team who knows a little science."
Star Trek,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2065055/,3,"I'm not going to hit this from a scientific perspective. That would be too easy and would just invite others to castigate me for not ""suspending disbelief"" during a fun summer sci-fi. No, this movie sucks on a very base level. The first, and most disturbing part of the movie is the villain, Nero, who I think is the worst villain Hollywood has given us, and Hollywood once gave us Arnold as Ice Man. Nero is awful because his motivation makes no sense whatsoever.As the story goes, Nero is furious at Spock, and by extension his whole race of Vulcans, because Spock did not get to Romulus' star in time to save it from super nova, which destroyed his planet and all those he loved and cared for. In the process both he and Spock are sucked into a black hole and spit out the other side well in the past, except at different times, Nero 25 years before Spock. In waiting 25 years for Spock to come through the black hole as he had, Nero and his crew seethe with rage and plot their revenge against Spock and his evil race of Vulcans.But why? Did Spock create the super nova? No. That was explained as a natural disaster. Did Spock try to save his planet? Yes. In fact, he had every reason to believe that he was going to die in the process. After failing to stave off the super nova, he was sucked into a black hole, which is assumed to destroy anything entering it (after all, black holes literally crush atoms to the point of not existing). Personally I think that makes Spock a hero to the Romulans! Having a vendetta against Spock and the Vulcans would be like tracking down and killing the family of a fire fighter who died in your house while he tried to save your wife and kids. That makes no sense. None. Last, Nero is now in the past, no? Why doesn't he just go about saving his planet from destruction? He's got the ""red matter"" to do it.The other thing that ticked me off was the silly string of ""accidents"" that put a gang of 22 year-olds in command of the Federation's flagship. Do they not have even a single 40 year-old who has actually been in space before? It's even worse than that if you think about it. Before the ship takes off Kirk is about to be booted out of Starfleet—but now he's put in charge?I'm willing to suspend disbelief in sci-fi movie, but there's a difference between suspending disbelief and watching a movie like I'm a 3-year old. 3 stars out of 10."
Overlord,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4459356/,3,"I don't know if the critics watched the same movie I did. This was a mediocre action movie, a mediocre horror movie, and a poor war movie. They went all out with the historical inaccuracies, so why not do it with a little humor? This movie took itself way too seriously. Watch it as a download."
Midnight Special,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5387554/,6,"I really enjoyed most of the movie thanks to the mystery factor, the actors who all play well - may it be the main or the supporting roles or the almost flawless production.But there's so much build-up for something minor. Potential is definitely there, but disappointing in total."
RoboCop,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2973249/,8,"The 1980's were and are a treasure trove for action movie lovers who were blessed with an abundance of classic action tales ranging from Terminator, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and countless other flicks that looked to take names and ask questions later. Dutch wild child Paul Verhoeven's 1987 bout of robotic justice can sit proudly alongside those classic entries as a shamelessly fun and over the top piece of blood infused entertainment.For some unbeknown reason I have in my many years of film watching never seen Peter Weller strut his stuff as Alex Murphy a man who becomes our titular Robocop (a fact made all the more shameful on my behalf considering I was holed up working in a video store for more than 5 years) but I am glad I have now rectified that problem. Robocop is a film filled with subtle smarts and ingenious ideas that were fantastically realised by Verhoeven with some ripping makeup design and typically brutal 1980's action scenes littering the picture. There is an air of fun and playfulness throughout the picture that are all infrequent in today's action films with Robocop not afraid to lighten the mood along with mixing in themes that are more meaningful and heartfelt, a mood that is heightened by a cast full of colourful and committed actors.Peter Weller in the role he will always be remembered for is great as our hero Murphy, playing the man and machine with an always calm yet readily menacing presence. As he quips his way through the movie we are always on his side and that's without the film bothering with much exposition at all. Other actors in the piece from Nancy Allen's female cop Anne and Kurtwood Smith's downright slimy Clarence J. Boddicker. All make their characters there's which fits in fantastically with Verhoeven's at times ingenious direction.When you watch Robocop today you really get the sense that even though it has now happened a remake/reboot is entirely unnecessary with the original still standing up in today's standards and still packing both a punch in the entertainment and social commentary stakes. If you're thinking about going to see the new Robocop why not just watch the original instead? As they say the original is always the best.4 steps out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
Predestination,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4595261/,9,"Amazing scenario, totally head crushing! Begging of the film you just trying to understand the main topic of film but one film moment is a part of suprising chain. My brain was on fire. Watch before you die. You won't regret"
Solaris,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0854805/,9,"First off, if you are looking for shoot 'em up, space ship flying through the stars, hunting aliens type of science fiction, don't even bother with this film. If you are looking for a Science Fiction film that explores the human condition in the way that Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Contact does, then this is right up your alley.This film is not about events and actions, it's about ideas and concepts. People looking for plot points to move them along will be bored to death with this film because most of the action of this film are those that will happen in your head. It is about people, desires, regrets and what we would be willing to do if we could have that one thing we cannot have back.Some people complain about the fact that Clooney's character of Chris does very little psychiatric work in this film. But, the truth of the matter is that his occupation is used more to propel his anti-faith views. I haven't seen it mentioned, but there is a reason why there are a lot of discussion about God, religion and faith in this film.Throughout the film, Chris questions and belittles Rheya's religious views, seeing the idea of putting stock in something that he sees as fantasy as being useless and just a crutch for people deluding themselves into a happiness based on illusion. Chris comes to realize that he would give up anything to be with Rheya, whether being with her is an illusion or not. His happiness depends on her, and he realizes that accepting what he needs is not a weakness -- as accepting faith is not a weakness -- it is simply a choice to fulfill one's life, whether it be real or illusion. And, as philosophers would argue, who can really say which is which?For those who want a science fiction film to make you think (like Blade Runner does), this film is it. With a tremendous cast, beautiful production design, excellent direction, and one of the best film scores in recent years (hats off to Cliff Martinez), I have no trouble recommending this film to anybody who is in the need of an intelligent, thought-provoking film."
Scanners,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5581137/,2,"I cannot describe to you how poorly I thought this movie was executed.First I'll start with things I liked:
I thought the concept was interesting. The idea that telepathy was just reading minds, but the connection to who/what you were reading/reading exploiting. The effects were very well done. Other than the comical shaking people did when they were scanning or being scanned.The driving of the story relies on compelling/interesting characters, this movie is devoid of that. Our main character, his mentor, the sidekicks, the villain were just so bad. They had little to no emotion it was like they were told to not act.The dialogue in the movie was awful, to say the least. The actors delivery of the lines made it seem like they were reading it off of cue cards off camera. There were quite a few scenes where the actors look like they were waiting for the scene to start a second before acting.The audio was not lined up well with the timing of their lips, and it really took me out of the movie. Which is what made me more critical of the other areas.Why did the doctor have a medical room in his kitchen? Why did they shoot Kim with a tranq then just leave? Why did Cameron and Daryl constantly say their full names? How does short circuiting a computer blow it up and a gas station? Why are we supposed to believe Cameron is the good guy when he clearly has psychotic tendencies?Watch this movie if you want to have a laugh picking it apart. It's free on Amazon."
Contact,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4610033/,9,"I had the luck of watching contact at the cinema when it came out . Being young meant that watching a movie of this grandure in a grand movie theatre with massive screen (something that was dying out at the time) means that this movie has been engraved in my mind .
But it is not due to nostalgia or corrupt memory .
Contact is a thought provoking mind bending movie ahead of its time .
In fact it is the Interstellar of the 90s .Stunning gorgeous visuals , and a storyline and plot asking some hard questions and providing answers that many might not want to accept as the movie battles between science fitction , science fact and religion in a way that in the end no one is left wanting .This is not just a movie , this is an event !"
The Dead Zone,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1431051/,9,"Well-done big screen adaptation of the Stephen King novel is one of the most acclaimed King-based films ever, and rightfully so.School teacher awakens from a five year coma to discover that he has the power to see into a person's past or future trauma by merely touching them.The story that drives this solid thriller is a well-rounded and often moving character study. It's a compelling tale with some great sequences of suspense and the occasional good jolt. Director David Cronenberg delivers splendidly well-shot sequences in this film, as well as a nice atmospheric kind of bleakness that's completely in tune with our story. The music score is also quite beautiful.The cast is the best highlight however. Star Christopher Walken does perhaps one of his best performances as our tormented hero, whom we build quite a bond with. Brook Adams is quite good as Walken's lost love. Martin Sheen is impressive as a sinister politician. Tom Skerritt and Colleen Dewhurst are also good in their small roles.All around The Dead Zone is a wonderful film, even if you're not a fan of Stephen King.Remade as a TV series in 2002*** 1/2 out of ****"
Pitch Black,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1077480/,8,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group.The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well-written characters.The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drug-habit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both.Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be.So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer."
Her,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2935265/,10,"This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time."
Repo Man,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0214580/,10,"The plot is impossible to describe but, basically, it's about a 20 something named Otto (Estevez) who works as a repo man.  That's about it...the movie chronicles all his bizarre adventures and strange people he meets.I saw this when I was in college in 1984--it totally blew me away.  I went back to see it 4 more times!  It had a huge following on college campuses back then.  Sadly, it seems to have disappeared.  That's a shame because I think this is perfect for high school, college kids and people with open minds. It is a true cult film.  There are many great lines--too many to get in one viewing--this film demands multiple viewings.  The actors deal well with the offbeat dialogue and situations--especially Estevez and Stanton.  As for what it means---who cares?  Every time I saw it I saw something different in it.A classic.  Do not miss!"
WALL·E,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1900345/,10,"I can't say enough about how good this movie, that you probably haven't read, so I'm going to keep this short.This is the best thing out there in theater's right now, and might just be the best animated film of all time, whether you believe that or not, is your own opinion, but what Pixar has done here, can put companies like Dreamworks, Sony, and Blue sky to shame.Wall E also may go down as the most lovable character ever to grace the movie screen, I praise Ben Burtt and Andrew Stanton, and the people at Pixar for what they did, and will continue to do.This is why Pixar is the top studio in the world.10/10"
Under the Skin,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2996745/,1,"OK, so we sat through the entire film. We left after the credits rolled and looked at each other with the ""WTF was that!"" look. Some observations: 1. Scarlett had one facial expression throughout the whole film 2. Those who compare it to the works of Stanley Kubrick have obviously not seen a Stanley Kubrick film 3. The soundtrack was annoying which I would contribute to the director having made too many music videos 4. Too many holes in the script to mention here 5. Who were the guys on the motorcycle and how come they did not need to ""feed"" ? 6. The reviews I had read mentioned that it used ground breaking techniques in camera placement (in the van), Have these guys seen any episodes of COPS? That is inventive camera placement! 7. And what was she thinking when she signed on to do this film???"
Men in Black,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0425629/,0,"MEN IN BLACK (1997) ***1/2  Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub, Siobahn Fallon.  Giddily hilarious sci-fi comedy: think a 90s ""Ghostbusters"" meets the ""X-Files"": hard-as-nails, deadpan Jones (a great master straight man) is one of many secret agents of MIB (Men In Black) recruiting steetsmart, mouthy Smith (a great wiseass) to team up and stop an intergalactic alien bug (in rotting human form D'Onofrio who gives a brilliant, funny turn) from wiping out the Earth and all mankind.  Incredible out there special effects from ILM and ingenious aliens from self-professed ""Monster Maker"" makeup guru Rick Baker. Hip, clever dialogue and fine chemistry from the odd couple gives this comic book adaptation of Lowell Cunningham a glossy work over including Bo Welch's inventive production design and Danny Elfman's atmospheric score. Fluid direction by Barry Sonnefield."
Elysium,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2905580/,1,"The story is full of plot holes and the characters are full of 1-dimensional simpletons.Elysium, can heal anyone at any time at no cost, in minutes! Except that it won't because the people of Elysium are cruel, evil, and utterly malicious. Literally Hitler.The bad guys continue to be bad guys, for no apparent reason or motivation. Just because it's fun!! List of plot holes: 1. They can restrict air traffic, but re-open it as they are transporting a high-value target? 2. They need to use radiation on robots? Why? 3. The floor manager is cruel enough to force you to do dangerous life-threatening actions because he can? 4. The smugness and evil of the Elysium-citizens... ""Don't breathe in my direction!"" Seriously? Who wrote this, a 12 year old writing a comic book? 5. They can make people explode with auto-tracking homing ninja grenades--yet they can't do that for Matt Damon? 6.

Never Let Me Go,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2322192/,10,"""Never Let Me Go,"" is an almost perfect adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel but it is going to have a hard time finding an audience because it is slow, sad, and depressing.I had finished the book 2 weeks before I saw the movie, so the story was fresh in my mind. I think that it really helps to read the book first because it fills in a lot of the gaps that are missing in the movie.Even if you haven't read the book, the film is still worth seeing for the performances of Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield, and Keira Knightly.The only reason the film does not rate a perfect 10 is that in the scene where they are trying to get a ""deferral"" from Madame, they left out what is probably the most important part of the story. In that scene in the book, Madame explains to them that the boarding school they went to was paid for by donations and fund raising so that they could be brought up like normal people. Before that, the clones were brought up in concentration camps and treated inhumanly. The whole point of that scene was that Madame and a few others were willing to make great sacrifices because they believed the clones had all the same rights and sentience as all other humans, while the rest of the world thought of them as livestock that were being bred for consumption.Even though that scene was left out of the film, the final line in the film alludes to the same message and it is a real tearjerker. Don't be fooled into thinking ""Never Let Me Go"" is a science fiction movie. It is not. It is a human drama with a science fiction premise. This is not like ""Logan's Run"" and it really does not go into the details of the science behind the premise. It is a sad and melancholy story about the human condition. If you go into it knowing what to expect, it is highly recommended."
Pacific Rim,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2829525/,0,"As far as summer blockbusters go, 'Pacific Rim' has probably the most unabashedly uncomplicated premise - giant robots versus giant monsters. How much you enjoy Guillermo del Toro's robot-monster smackdown ultimately depends on whether you expect the movie to be any more than that. If you did, then you're probably going to walk away disappointed at how simplistic this apocalyptic spectacle will turn out to be; but if you're satisfied simply with watching huge-ass monsters and robots go up against each other, then you will enjoy every bit of this epic (and yes we do mean it literally).Indeed, the draw of del Toro's monster of a movie has always been to witness the monumental series of battles between massive lizard-like monsters (referred to in the movie by the Japanese word 'Kaiju' as a tribute to the science fiction films from the country which featured such giant beasts, e.g. Godzilla) and 25-story high robots (known as Jaegers, or 'hunters' in German) operated by humans. And in this regard, let us assure you that nothing in your expectation will prepare you for what del Toro has managed to accomplish on screen - not even comparing it to a 'Godzilla' meets 'Transformers' movie does it any justice.Let's start with the basics. First and foremost, the action is shot cleanly, meaning none of them shaky-cams nor extreme close-ups that diminish the scale on which it is unfolding. It is also coherent - thanks to some impressive work from del Toro regular Guillermo Navarro as cinematographer and John Gilroy and Peter Amundson as editors - rather than just a mashup of scenes that don't flow well into one another. We'll add one more before we start gushing - it is also beautifully choreographed, with just the right mix of medium and wide shots to place you right into the heart of the action.If that description above seems too clinical, then how about this - these setpieces are superb; in fact, they are worthy of every superlative that you can think of. Working on a gargantuan scale, del Toro executes the action with magnificence, whether the fleeting shots of the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge at the beginning or the more detailed sequences in the middle and at the end - in particular, a simply jaw-dropping one begins at sea just off the waters of Hong Kong and then continues seamlessly inland where both the port and the very city centre gets decimated by two Jaegers battling two Category 4 Kaijus.It isn't just about how colossal it gets; it is also the sheer mesmerising quality of the images, starting from the amazing level of detail of the Jaegers and the Kaijus. Even though it seems to be raining a little too conveniently every time one of these battles happens out at sea, there's no denying just how real and majestic each of them feels. On the other hand, the cityscapes are arresting in their neon hues, and the combination of the futuristic look with which del Toro paints these familiar cities with the bioluminescent appendages and venom of the Kaijus make for a particularly appealing visual palette.Now that we've finished with the savoury bits, it is only fair that we get to the (ahem) less than wieldy parts, which is in actual fact just about everything else we have yet to talk about. At first, the science- fiction mythology sounds rather intriguing - instead of coming from the skies, the threat to our planet came from a rift deep within the Pacific Ocean, a portal through which the Kaijus emerged and necessitated an equally massive response in the form of the Jaegers. Ditto the functioning of the Jaegers, which given their size, have to be operated by two pilots who sync up their minds via the neural handshake, otherwise known as the ""drift"".But del Toro and his fellow screenwriter Travis Beacham (who is also credited with this original story) uses these elements too mechanically. The rift is no more than an excuse for an underwater climax where the Jaegers aim to close the portal from which the Kaijus emerged, a resolution not quite different from that in 'The Avengers'. More significantly, the melding of minds isn't quite exploited for enough dramatic possibility, particularly given its significance in enabling our two lead pilots, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) to bond so seamlessly with each other.Equally clunky is the characterisation, which has as much poignancy as a piece of metal. Raleigh's scarred Jaeger pilot, still reeling at first from the death of his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), heals too quickly for us to make much of an emotional connection. Mori's own traumatic near-death experience as a child that continues to haunt her also rings hollow and is equally quickly forgotten. Idris Elba plays his Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost in suitably macho fashion, but is largely one-note and engineered simply to deliver the rallying cries at suitable intervals - like the oft-heard ""Today, we are cancelling the apocalypse"" in the trailers.No thanks to the plotting and character issues, the pacing of the movie sags considerably after a prolonged prologue establishing the necessary backstory of the robots-versus-monsters war and Raleigh's own past. It only picks up at the halfway mark when the deep-sea monsters finally clash again with their mechanical counterparts, which will either be stimulating enough (if you're an adolescent fanboy) to make you wet your pants or leave you numb. Our opinion? It is del Toro's most ambitious, most imaginative and probably most groundbreaking movie ever, but we wish there were more of the warmth and character that have defined some of his best work."
War for the Planet of the Apes,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3798035/,10,"After seeing WAR for the first time, I left the theater not knowing how I felt about it. I had seen the film opening day being a huge fan of the rebooted trilogy and in love with the main characters in the previous two films. Because I was so connected with the characters in this film, the movie was not very enjoyable. I couldn't sit still, I didn't take a bite of my popcorn, I only breathed a good two times throughout its run time, and the moment the end credits rolled I felt exhausted. I went home and pondered over how I felt about the movie and even when I came to a conclusion I was unsure.That may have sounded harsh and you're now wondering why I would ever give this movie a 10, but I rated this movie a perfect because it really was a perfect film, ending, and trilogy. I got to wondering why the movie was so emotionally draining and I realized that this was the director, Matt Reeves', goal. I was so invested into the characters, (that are not even the same species as me,) that I couldn't bear to watch the torture some of them went through. I loved the characters so much that I wanted to scream at the thought of losing one of them by the end. The way we've seen these apes evolve throughout 3 films is exciting. The actors and directors do an amazing job at making certain apes lovable, some that we don't even know their names, the more obvious ones being Ceaser, Maurice, and (my personal favorite) Rocket.Woody Harrelson sells his character for what is given, even though there isn't much to work with. I understand where they were trying to go with his character, however he was used in a more story driven way then a powerful presence as a villain, which I'm totally fine with. He had a very Hitler-esque way about him which was creepy and very surprising. The title, War for the Planet of the Apes, is not necessarily referring to the War which was taking place subtly, however the inner conflict happening within Ceaser's mind, which unlike other people, I adored. The new characters added into this film were risky, yet they really worked. Unlike some of the characters we've had since RISE, Nova and Bad Ape are introduced into this final installment. Not having enough time to introduce both of these characters, Reeves manages to get the audience to care for them both, which is pure art. Everyone knows the visuals are superb and unlike anything we've ever seen so I won't elaborate on it more than that. (They're great.)Michael Giacchino's score is wonderful and my personal favorite of his. He brings a jungle feel and mixes it with soft piano lullaby's that intrigues the audience just as much as the visuals. The film really tricks you into believing a certain character will finally have a change of heart. However, they rip your heart out with one of the most shocking scenes I have ever witnessed, which is a tragic yet remarkable piece of work. Those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about.The ending is perfectly executed, yet leaves you in a mourning state. In respect, I stayed through the end of the credits in mourning for one of the greatest characters in film history. Andy Serkis has proved once again that he is the best actor in the game. Though I loved this movie, there was one major thing that I was disappointed with.(SPOILER) After watching DAWN, I was most excited to see more of Ceaser's son, Blue Eyes. I understand losing him drove the story forward, however I was really disappointed we didn't get to see his character grow. All in all, WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is a remarkable film. It is a great end to a trilogy and one of my favorite films of all time. The team behind this movie nailed every minute of it. Give the movie a chance and see it again. Because I believe it is a masterpiece. Apes Together Strong. Thanks for reading....-O"
Galaxy Quest,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0607035/,9,"There are very few comedies out there that manage to get laughs from all of the jokes; ""Galaxy Quest"" is one of the few films that pretty much gets them all.As corny as it sounds, the film is practically perfect in its execution. It parodies a genre that had been screaming for it for decades. It's funny from start to finish and even manages to have a heart while on the way.When the film was first released in theatres, I didn't have any desire to see it. I don't think the advertising was right for the film. I am a huge ""Star Trek"" fan and I found the advertising made the picture look stupid with juvenile humor. A co-worker insisted I see it, saying if I didn't I would regret it for the rest of my life.Luckily I didn't ignore him, because he would have been right!There are a lot of reviews for this film here, most of them positive. I am quite glad to see that I am not alone in my praise for this film.Most certainly it's not ""Citizen Kane"" by any means, but for what it is and what it is trying to do, it succeeds in every aspect. The screenplay is technically brilliant (in terms of structure, characterization, and wit!). ILM does a terrific job in the visual effects department (as they most often do), and David Newman's score not only parodies but also develops into a heartwarming action score (a paradox? I think not!).""Galaxy Quest"" - If you haven't seen it yet and you love ""Star Trek,"" I only have to ask.....""what ARE you.....waiting for?"""
Face/Off,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0415103/,0,"This one has a tough job of convincing the audience that the main characters, Travolta and Cage, could swap faces via plastic surgery and still be convincing as one another. It works! Woo has a certain style down-the long flowing robes, slow mo shootouts, orchestral hype in the background, furious shoot outs, explosions, etc.  Essentially a more stylish Bruckheimer movie if ya think about it.I have always liked the Bald guy and Gina Gershon here the most from the supporting cast, and enjoyed the way both the leads got to 'understand' the others' family, way of life, friends, etc.  You have to like how Castor gets Travolta's girl to learn knife fighting, for example, or seeing the camaraderie of Cage's group. Good shootouts and action, sometimes the conceits here are quite far flung, but you can live with that as an audience. I sure did, and so give this...*** outta ****, it's quite good"
V for Vendetta,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1311710/,10,"I saw this movie yes today here in Denmark, and i didn't know what to  expect, because i haven't heard of the V or read the Comics from  publisher DC comics.  But was i in for a BIG treat, this movie is so superbly acted by all  the actors, especially Natalie Portman performed according to me to an  Oscar nomination next year.  The movie is perfectly put together, so if you haven't read the comics  you will be on the edge of you seat the whole movie. Its really that  good folks.  And lastly, the visual effects is fantastic, and the action scenes is  nothing but spectacular.  Watch this movie :-)."
Starman,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3299441/,10,"Reportedly John Carpenter shot this movie as a way to show people that he could still understand what the audience wanted after the critical and financial disaster of his previous high-profile assignment, The Thing. Whether he proved his point or not is open to interpretation, although the fact that Starman was essentially his last big budget movie during the 80's and the director eventually kept spiraling farther away from the mainstream is probably evidence that this film didn't go as planned either. What Carpenter did accomplish though in the process, is craft the best serious take on an encounter with an alien civilization, at least until Contact came along.Compared to any other of Carpenter's films, Starman is perhaps the most singular and also the most genre-bending of any of his projects. You might have thought he pushed the envelope with Big Trouble in Little China, but Starman goes even further. The story is part alien encounter, part road movie, part romance and manages to mix its elements competently and switch gears expertly, propelled by two great performance by a young Jeff Bridges (this was his first Oscar nomination) and Karen Allen. Production values are also very high. Special effects, although not ubiquitous, are very imaginative and brilliantly executed whenever they occur. There are several shots in this one that have become iconic, such as the Starman transformation sequence early in the film, accomplished through a rare collaboration of two effects masters of the period, Stan Winston and Rick Baker. The movie is also graced with a spectacular score by Jack Nitzsche, elevating scenes like the finale into levels of otherworldly beauty.When it comes to Carpenter films, I consider this to be his finest, even compared to such gems as The Thing and Halloween. The fact that this isn't even remotely a horror film, so far from the director's comfort zone, makes it all the more remarkable. A classic and some of the most intelligent sci-fi you are ever going to find."
Logan's Run,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0148190/,8,"Beyond the entrapment of lavish special effects (for which ""Logan's Run"" won an Oscar anyway), few science fiction films actually present a good story, much less one that makes you think and/or presents new ideas.  ""Logan's Run"" is one of those few.Before ""Stars Wars"" enraptured audiences with its stunning special effects and created a precedent for a string of similarly effects-laden knock-offs and genre wanna-be's (mirroring what ""The War of the Worlds"" had done for audiences in the 50's), true science fiction films such as ""Logan's Run"" were giving us stories simply complimented by special effects, not about them.  I say ""true"" because ""Star Wars"" is of the fantasy genre; it is not a science fiction story, though it does share some common elements.""Logan's Run"" presents us with a vivid, somewhat horrifying vision of a possible future.  It doesn't take place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.""  It happens on earth in a believable time frame.  It doesn't ask us to greatly suspend disbelief by accepting alien races and magic powers. Instead, it presents us with a chilling fast forward of our own technology, attitudes, and policies.  Concerning the latter, the film includes an almost creepy euthanasia undertone to it.Though, in all honesty, I care more about and become more closely associated with the characters in ""Star Wars,"" the disassociation I feel for LR's characters somewhat aids the lack of individuality that the story tries to convey.  The actors, however, give great performances.Beautiful cinematography and settings greatly compliment the film's mood and timeframe, from the sterile domed city to the decimated Washington D.C., which still provides one of (if not) the best visuals of a post-apocalyptic world that I've ever seen.  It's right there with ""The Planet of the Apes'"" Statue of Liberty.Another thing that SW does well is disassociate itself from the decade in which it was created.  You have to overlook this aspect in LR because like so many films of the 70's, it carries its decade's time stamp.Though minor, another thing I, in particular, enjoy about LR are the weapons.  Unlike every other weapon in and out of science fiction history, LR's ""blasters"" do not actually shoot anything.  There is simply an explosion at their designated target.  It may be campy (or corny), but it's definitely different and a fine example of real, working props.Another interesting note: the film varies greatly from the original novel, but most people agree that the film is much better.  I tend to agree with them.For me, in terms of science fiction, ""Logan's Run"" takes its place among such decade-defining films as ""The War of the Worlds"" (50's) and ""The Planet of the Apes"" (60's) and among such thought-provoking science fiction as ""Soylent Green"" and ""Gattaca.""Ask yourself this: what or where is ""sanctuary?""  Isn't that what we're all looking for?  Answer both, and you'll have the film's theme."
Ghostbusters,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3718231/,8,"Ghostbusters is a charming, funny and entertaining film. I initially thought I wasn't going to like it much, but after viewing it, I enjoyed this film a lot. The film is about a 4 men ""busting"" ghosts. Thats about it for the most part. I can definitely see why people like this film a lot. I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it.Rating: 8/10 (out of 100): 89%"
Attack the Block,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2482818/,1,"This is without doubt the worst film I have seen this year, I really hoped it would be much better because I'd been looking forward to it for a such a long time. I'm a fan of Joe Cornish and I was raised on films like Gremlins and Critters. This film really has very little in common with either of them, they at the very least were original and entertaining.So, attack the block - terrible dialog, awful acting, rubbish aliens (think men in gorilla suits), an unsatisfying and dull story...... was it supposed to be sf, horror, comedy ? It didn't succeed at any of them.But worst thing of all, this is a film that actually seems to glorify hoody culture, it made me angry that a film that is obviously aimed at teenagers makes it look cool to carry weapons like knives, smoke weed all day, steal and mug people.In the current climate, especially in the UK shouldn't film-makers take a bit more responsibility. In the opening scene we were treated to 5 masked teenagers terrifying and mugging a young woman on her way home from work. I almost switched off, but hoped there might be some sort of moral ending ..... no such luck, the ring leader survives and is worshipped as a hero. There were only 2 educated characters portrayed in the film and they were made to look like pathetic losers all the way though. I don't know if this film set out to show gang culture and stealing as cool and fun alternative to gaining an education and working but this seems to be one of the messages it is sending out."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0300473/,9,"I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,but T2 certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in my opinion, of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in terms of greatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy once again,but you don't mind once you witness the incredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film is nothing short of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forget the talents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave great supporting efforts.Thumbs up!"
Cloud Atlas,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2716192/,1,"I'm going to buck the trend here and instead of extolling the virtues of this wonderful spiritual journey through time and space, I'm going to call it an undisciplined, self-indulgent, incoherent piece of claptrap. I really feel like this is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes. I'm standing up and saying the old guy is naked and he's ugly to boot. They said this was a book that couldn't be made into a movie. They were right. And it was pointless to try. What you were likely to get was... this! If you've read the book and liked it, then you might like the film too. But just remember, you are bring understanding and structure to what you see. If you haven't read the book and know little about it, this movie is likely to be a frustrating and incoherent mess to you. That was certainly my experience. So don't get suckered into going to see this godawful film ""cold."" Tom Hanks looked like he had a grand time being part of it. You won't."
Alien: Covenant,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3705095/,5,"Set 10 years after the events of 'Prometheus,' the story begins with the crew of the colony ship Covenant receiving a possible distress call coming from an uncharted planet that seemed to be paradise for humans to live on. Once there, the crew discover the world is much dangerous than it seems but none more dangerous than encountering David, the android from the doomed Prometheus expedition.From the get go, none of the human characters in 'Covenant' are interesting or memorable enough and except for a few, most of them are just faceless red shirts. Some of them act annoyingly hysterical which results in some face-palming reactions and some act like they're in a B-movie slasher flick, but worst of all, a few do something so incredibly stupid that you end up wondering if Weyland- Yutani intentionally hires morons to be part of their billion dollar expeditions.Katherine Waterston plays Daniels and although she is probably the ""best"" character among these losers, she's not written very well nor does she have any notable moments. Michael Fassbender did a superb job with his dual role of David and Walter. Most were expecting Danny McBride to stink up the place but he turned out to be one of the very few reasonably decent characters. Billy Crudup's Oram joins the ranks of Fifeld and Millburn as the dumbest people in the 'Alien' series.Despite the many flaws of 'Prometheus' and the numerous dumb human actions, the characters there were at least not boring and Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) was a good leading character that had many memorable exciting scenes. 'Prometheus' even had some thrilling action spectacle that wowed audience and expanded the Alien mythology.Those that are expecting to learn more about the Engineers will be sorely disappointed as they are just briefly touched upon. The whole movie just feels like one big glorified set-up to show the transition from black goo to neomorph to finally xenomorph. Ridley Scott stated he plans to make three more 'Alien' prequels after Covenant. The problem now is we will get three more movies in the future to convolutedly and exhaustively tie everything up leading up to the first 'Alien' movie where the Engineer spacecraft somehow lands at the LV-426 moon.The horror element in 'Covenant' is quite satisfactory, showcasing some spine-chilling terror and graphic kills. The action though is hugely disappointing with the last two big action sequences being uninspiring and unexceptional. The pacing during the last few minutes after the fake-out ending seemed rushed and dissonant. The xenomorph felt shoehorned. The pink-skinned neomorph was a worthy adversarial monster on its own and much creepier than the xenomorph.If this is what Ridley Scott has in store for future Alien prequels, he should just stop and do something else. Or better yet, allow Neill Blomkamp to proceed with his planned 'Alien' do-over sequel where Hicks and Newt are still alive. Interest for the 'Alien' franchise will probably die down steadily with each prequel Ridley releases. This is starting to feel more and more like when George Lucas' botched up the 'Star Wars' prequels.In space, no one can hear you scream. With each passing Alien prequels, no one cares anymore.RATING: 5.5/10 or 6/10"
Snowpiercer,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3018578/,3,"This movie is an abomination of plot holes, pure stupidity and genius.Unfortunately the genius is only viewable in the beautiful artwork done for this movie, because indoor shots as well as outdoor shots are breathtaking.Spoilers ahead.However, every character in the movie seems to have a death wish, if they are not too busy poking holes in the plot wider than a train tunnel.This movie is best watched either high on Krenole ( the industrial waste people seem to be enjoying blowing away their brains with in Snowpiecer, pun intended... ) or with a good portion of surreality, because nothing in this movie is anywhere close to being made intelligently.To people who say this is a movie criticizing our society: The only thing that this movie portrays is an astounding stupidity on everybody's part. Nothing deep or thoughtful happens in this movie. NOTHING.You can read any review here on this movie scored 3 or lower and get tons of good ideas on how to NOT DO A MOVIE, but for my own amusement I will list my own top ten ( or twenty or more. You could basically do this all day long ).1) No guard posts are set up, even though there is open rioting going on. Oh, wait. I forgot about the new holiday policy on the train.2)The stupidity of having to control your population by having riots killing off people regularly is... well, at least you save on condoms, right? 3) After FIVE MINUTES of massacre in the tunnel literally everybody is still alive and can call out for torch lights being carried Olympian style through the entire length of the train, to arrive there five more minutes later, to still find everybody intact and in fighting shape. Oh and that torch obviously had babies on its way to the fray. Cute. 4) A full store cabin of foodstuff, yet not a single cart carrying actual livestock. I am guessing the train is actually piggybacked on a cattle trail. Made immune to cold. Yepp, sounds about right. Makes more sense than the engine being a perpetual motion thing anyway. 5) Luring your enemies into your child's classroom, only for the PREGNANT teacher drawing out an Uzi to assassinate them is PURE GENIUS! I always knew teachers had a dark streak, much like clowns, and finally giving them the chance to act on their frustrations... WELL DONE!6) Gilliam works from inside the tail section to instigate riots to help the population control. So we are to believe that a guy gave his arm to cannibalize on willingly to safe a baby in order to stick to a lifetime of poverty and dirt in the tail section to regularly send people to their death? Lolwut? Oh, wait, I forgot. Evereybody on this train is a mental patient, so all is well and everybody is acting normally, within their respective limits.7) I don't think I can do more than five. My eye is starting to twitch nervously just thinking of writing more about this train wreck of a movie.Overall the entire movie gives a lasting impression of a feverish dream while being on a bad trip.And in the end, when everybody except two have killed them self off, you see them meeting a polar bear in the Himalayas and you know everything is going to be well: The polar bear will eat those two, too, and finally the entire train of stupid has come to a halt. Thank you, Mister Polar Bear. Well done!"
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1153732/,10,"Despite the feelings of most ""Star Wars"" fans, in my opinion ""Return Of The Jedi"" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. Ever since the first time I saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the ""Star Wars"" saga in ""Jedi"".Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)After ""The Empire Strikes Back"" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in ""Return Of The Jedi"". Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction. The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; Darth Vader is in fact his father. The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor. It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks. During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life. Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, ""Return Of The Jedi"" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us."
Edge of Tomorrow,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4758775/,9,"Going into watching this movie, I'll be honest, I didn't expect much. I figured it was probably just some usual sci-fi movie with crappy effects and a lack of an actually interesting and full plot. The only thing that gave me hope was that Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were the stars of the movie. Soon enough, I realized I had seriously doubted this movie way more than I should have.First off, I love Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise, and their acting in this was phenomenal. It was fun to see Cruise in a role where he was helpless and lost; out of place (in the beginning), while Blunt was the badass female who trained him and built him up. Speaking of Blunt, her character Rita was a truly incredible character in my opinion, and Blunt did an excellent job of portraying her.Now onto the plot: this is where I was initially worried when I began the movie. However, I found myself really enjoying the movie very soon in, after catching onto some things. It made me think, which I liked, but also wasn't so unclear that I couldn't figure anything out. I thought that the time loop idea was very interesting and unique for a sci-fi movie, and even though things kept repeating, I was never bored or felt like there wasn't enough happening. I loved the action in this movie, and also the more tender moments between Rita and Cage. Movies that can make you cry and make you sit on the edge of your seat in suspense always intrigue me, and that's what this movie did for me. I just didn't want it to end.Side notes: I've watched some behind the scenes footage of this movie, and either all or a majority of the action sequences that we see in the movie were filmed, not inserted using CGI, which is very impressive. But to me, not more impressive than the fact that Blunt and Cruise each did their own stunts. These actors are so amazing in my opinion.
The only reason that this movie is getting 9 and not 10 stars from me is that I felt towards the beginning of the movie, the whole time loop thing was being dragged out a bit too much, I wanted things to move a bit quicker.*These are simply my opinions. I respect anyone and everyone's opinions, even if I don't agree with them, and I ask that you do the same with my review and others. Thank you.*"
Equilibrium,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0710363/,10,"I went in to see ""Equilibrium"" with no knowledge of the movie other than a two line synopsis from a local newspaper and the movie poster in the theater lobby.  As usual, I was practicing my theory of ""lowered expectations.""  I expect a movie to be horribly awful ahead of time, so I can not be disappointed.  I was not disappointed. At the end of the film I could not sit still in my seat.  I felt the urge to go out into the world and proclaim the utter awesomeness of ""Equilibrium.""  Such words as ""Sweet,"" ""Crazy,"" and ""Righteous"" sprang forth from my lips in rapid succession when I talked about the movie with my friends. Not since the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" have I desired to sing a movie's praises.  And I mean literally SING.  ""Equilibrium"" could, and should, be the sleeper hit of the year.  The film's action sequences stir up the blood and pump the adrenaline as if you were riding a roller-coaster.  The art style, while minimalistic, and thus maybe confused for low-budget by some, is actually quite successful in portraying a totalitarian and emotionless society.  The acting is excellent as well, and quite possibly the best I have seen in an action film in long time. While the nay-sayers will say that the film is too unoriginal, borrowing elements of its story and premise from ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""Brave New World,"" these complaints can be disregarded as the movie adds enough of its own style and story to make the comparisons plausible in basic premise only. In the end, like any movie, ""Equilibrium"" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well.  It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent whole.  Go see it. Go see it twice.  Go see ""Equilibrium,"" Cleric."
Contagion,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5570540/,7,"Had I watched this movie few months back , it wouldn't have been a big deal but now it's totally relatable. Literally its like , the current situation was all scripted years back !"
The Hidden,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3681055/,10,"The Hidden is the kind of flick that makes you sit back, sink a little deeper into the couch, take a long swig of lager and nostalgically murmur ""they don't make 'em like they used to."" Maybe I was just born in the wrong era, but the 80's and 90's just seemed to hurl forth so many winners, unbridled genre bliss that only got better with age, worth the revisit every time. The effects were practical, the stories were told with love, care and inspiration and the action was real, hard hitting and built to last. This one opens with what can literally only be described as a cinematic version of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto; we see a well dressed, determined man (Twin Peak's Chris Mulkey in batshhit mode) rob a bank, obliterate several police officers with a big honkin' shotgun, steal a Ferrari, drive said Ferrari through a busy park, smoke a dude in a wheelchair at over a hundred clicks, lead the entire police force on an apocalyptic highway chase and cheerfully get ventilated in a hailstorm of bullets upon careening through their barricade. Case closed, right? Not for a mysterious FBI Agent (Kyle MacLachlan) who arrives out of nowhere and commandeers the case from the leading detectives (Ed O Ross and a wicked sharp Michael Nouri). MacLachlan knows something the force doesn't, let alone would ever believe: there's an alien running around inhabiting human bodies a là Body Snatchers, and going on hedonistic tirades of the worst possible behaviour, hence the shotgun tantrum in the opener. How does he know this, you ask? Because he himself is an alien in a Kyle suit, intrepidly pursuing the other one from a distant galaxy to halt it's destructive shenanigans forever. It's a premise that could have opened the door to all sorts of ooey gooey creature effects, but the film minimizes on those, choosing a few key moments to show the slime, and focuses mainly on glass shattering, guns blazing action, a neat recipe of three parts action with a tablespoon of yuck, if you will. MacLachlan, still very young at the time, anchors his performance with emotional heft, amusing aloofness and the necessary grit that can be found in his iconic portrayal of Agent Dale Cooper on Twin Peaks, and I was reminded more than a few times of that character while watching him in this. As the extraterrestrial nutjob moves from host to host, blowing everything up and leaving a trail of massacred people in it's wake, the two of them race at every turn to catch up, and it's Nouri who finds the seething anger one must get watching an outsider roll up and stamp all over someone else's territory. The alien isn't interested in world domination, resources or assimilation, it just wants to f*ck sh*t up and have a good time, man. Blasting rock n' roll music, gorging itself on steak dinners, stealing every Ferrari it can get it's hands on and raiding the police evidence room for all kinds of heavy artillery, this thing doesn't slow down for a second. This is the only film I know that paints off-earth visitors quite like this, just a gleeful, anarchic adrenaline junkie as*%ole, and I admire the brutal honesty, because I know of quite a few morons who would probably engage in the exact same behaviour, should they ever find themselves incognito and without consequences on an unassuming, far away planet. This one is pure screaming fun the whole way through, and should be every bit as iconic as other sci fi tales that are remembered more prolifically. Watch for the tiniest Danny Trejo cameo, playing (guess what) a prison inmate."
The Manchurian Candidate,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1712301/,1,"This movie is a ghastly abomination, the movie-world equivalent of desecrating a corpse. You don't need to see the Frankenheimer original (which was pretty good, if not the classic it's sometimes made out to be) to see that this movie is garbage. Most obscenely, The Manchurian Candidate is routinely praised as ""smart,"" when in fact it is a 129-minute nonstop insult to the viewer's intellect, as well as to whatever artistic sensibilities he or she has.The story follows Denzel Washington's Bennett Marco, who is kidnapped along with his entire squad of U.S. infantrymen during the first Gulf War, a remarkable trick somehow pulled off single-handedly by his unarmed guide, who is evil because he works for a private contractor called Manchurian Global. Manchurian Global then uses Advanced Technology to brainwash them all, including the squad leader Sgt. Raymond Shaw, into machines who will kill their own comrades  or consent to be killed by them  without hesitation. Seventeen years later, Shaw's mother maneuvers him into running for Vice-President of the United States, his sole qualification being his fictitious war heroism, which is based on false memories implanted in him and his squad during the brainwashing. Manchurian Global leaves Marco alive, apparently because they want their evil plot foiled, which Marco proceeds to do.The idiocies that ensue are mind-boggling. I almost tore out my hair screaming WHY? 1. WHY does Senator Jordan advertise his knowledge of the coup plot to the plotters, while doing nothing to protect himself?2. WHY does Raymond Shaw drown the Senator with his bare hands in broad daylight (had Jordan been so much as carrying a pocket pistol, he could have defended himself)? 3. WHY does Jocelyne wade up to her father's murderer so he can drown her too, instead of calling 911 for help? 4. WHY does Manchurian bother implanting chips in Marco's and Shaw's shoulders, when it can control them equally well without the chips? 5. WHY doesn't Marco pull out the drainpipe trap to recover the chip he's dropped? 6. WHY isn't Marco arrested and imprisoned when he slugs his interrogator? 7. WHY doesn't Shaw press charges against Marco when Marco bites him? 8. WHY am I watching this movie? The ninth ""why"" is, ""why does anyone consider this movie intelligent?"" Doubtless, because it is transparently aimed at the crew of nitwits and fanatics that have run most of the U.S. government since 2001. For supporters of the American right wing, movies like this are a minor irritant at most. But for its opponents (and I am certainly one), this film is an infuriating example of the intellectual feebleness of the art world's resistance against the sectarian, paranoid, and authoritarian currents sweeping America.Rating: A million trillion zeros! Recommendation: What do you mean, the original is better? Hara-kiri would be better!"
Upstream Color,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2822855/,2,"Where to begin? Well, it's very possible that Upstream Colour has a very interesting premise. I can't really confirm this though because quite frankly this is one incomprehensible movie. It starts out fairly intriguing to be fair, with a woman abducted by a man who implants a modified maggot into her. This leaves her in some way under his control and he proceeds to get her to give all of her money to him. Another man pitches up and transfers her internal maggot into a pig. It appears that he has a group of pigs that are all connected to different people who have suffered a similar fate. Anyway, the girl has no memory of her ordeal and soon she meets a man who it turns out was also a victim of the same ordeal. It's at this point that the film goes rapidly downhill.Upstream Colour is one of those movies where things are certainly not spelled out to the audience. This in itself is not a criticism; it's often laudable in actual fact. But equally this in and of itself is does not necessarily mean a film should be praised. This movie lost me mainly because of the alienating presentation, it was impossible to empathise with the characters and the constant ambient soundtrack humming in the background only added to the detachment. The tone of the movie is more or less a flat line – beyond the interesting opening the story hums along in a one pitch manner. The dialogue scenes between the two central protagonists are very unengaging, bordering on tedious. Visually there were things of interest and its ambiguity was compelling to an extent but overall this one left me very cold."
Men in Black,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0425629/,0,"MEN IN BLACK (1997) ***1/2  Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub, Siobahn Fallon.  Giddily hilarious sci-fi comedy: think a 90s ""Ghostbusters"" meets the ""X-Files"": hard-as-nails, deadpan Jones (a great master straight man) is one of many secret agents of MIB (Men In Black) recruiting steetsmart, mouthy Smith (a great wiseass) to team up and stop an intergalactic alien bug (in rotting human form D'Onofrio who gives a brilliant, funny turn) from wiping out the Earth and all mankind.  Incredible out there special effects from ILM and ingenious aliens from self-professed ""Monster Maker"" makeup guru Rick Baker. Hip, clever dialogue and fine chemistry from the odd couple gives this comic book adaptation of Lowell Cunningham a glossy work over including Bo Welch's inventive production design and Danny Elfman's atmospheric score. Fluid direction by Barry Sonnefield."
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1087923/,10,"By giving this film a perfect score, I am in no way suggesting that it is free of flaws, but ambition makes up for imperfection, and, with this movie, George Lucas has set out to film a Greek tragedy on the largest scale ever attempted. The film certainly has its clunky moments, but so did all the other ""Star Wars"" films. Just go back and listen to Mark Hamill whine to his uncle in A New Hope.Whate gave me chills as I watched Revenge of the Sith were the numerous mythological and literary references. These were always highlights of the Star Wars films. It's what raised them above simple space adventures. There are references to Paradise Lost (Count Dooku to Anakin: ""Twiced the Pride, double the fall), Prometheus, Frankenstein (Vader's birth) etc.Anyone that enjoyed their first viewing of this film should see it again. There are so many details that are not explicitly stated but are meaningful none the less. These include plot details and various modes of symbolism employed by Lucas. Notice how, in their scenes together, Obi Wan is always more in the light and Anakin is more in the shadows. Additionally, there are hints at things that we are never told, but become more obvious with a repeated viewing. One such detail is that Anakin suspects Padame of having an affair with Obi Wan. He says accusingly to Padame, ""Obi Wan was here,"" when they are in her apartment. Then, in one of his vision's of Padame's birth, Anakin sees Obi Wan helping her with the delivery, suggesting that he is perhaps the father of Padame's child. Finally, on Mustafar, when Anakin sees Obi Wan come off of Padame's ship, he feels betrayed, not just because he thinks she's siding with Obi Wan, but also because he feels there might be something between the two of them.As for the criticism that Anakin's conversion to the Dark Side is unbelievable, I think that it is baseless. Lucas did a superb job of showing Anakin as someone who is too prideful and impatient. He will save Padame at any cost. Additionally, in the scene between Palpadine and Windu, the line between right and wrong has been blurred. By killing Palpadine, Windu would be violating the Jedi code. Palpadine also plays on Anakin's confusion by suggesting the Jedi are attempting to rule the Republic, something Windu already mentioned when he stated that the Jedi would have to take over temporary control of the Senate after Palpadine's arrest. Anakin draws his light saber, not to kill Windu, but to prevent him from committing a crime. He wants to stop Windu's light saber from killing Palpadine--the man who represents his only chance of saving Padame, but in his haste he accidentally cuts off Windu's hand. Once Anakin does this, he is lost. His life as a Jedi, the only life he's ever known, the only thing he's ever aspired to be, has been destroyed. When someone as prideful and immature as Anakin makes such a HUGE mistake it is often almost impossible for them to come to terms with what they have done. The result of this denial is often a defiant repetition of the bad act, a way of insisting to themselves and the world that they have done nothing wrong. These bad acts gain a momentum that eventually complete distorts their sense of morality.We must also remember that Sidious, or his Sith master, has used the Force to impregnate Anakin's mother with the expectation of him one day becoming the galaxy's most powerful sith lord. Palpadine/Sidious has spent all of Anakin's life grooming him for the moment he changes his allegiance. Sidious has befriended Anakin, given him a taste of power and planted seeds of doubt regarding the Jedi's true intentions. He has been the closest thing to a father Anakin has ever had. With all this in mind, Anakin's conversion seems justified.As for the acting and dialogue that are being relentlessly bashed, I submit that it's not as bad as some would suggest. Christensen's angry, confused brooding is mostly dead on while portraying a major shift in his character. MacGregor is at his best as Obi Wan. Even Portman's diminished role in this film is thoughtfully portrayed. Above all, the actors and Lucas seem to be having much more fun with this film. They have loosened up and it shows. There are humorous moments that cut through the political debate and relentless action. There are even a few quiet moments that subtly allude to strong emotions that Lucas fails to portray through his dialogue, such as the scene where Anakin is looking out of window of the Jedi council, across the city to where Padame is looking back across the city at him. This important scene illuminates Anakin's frame of mind before he hurries to the Senator's chamber to stop Windu from killing him.Visually, this film is absolutely stunning, so much so that I had to see it a second time just to take in the tremendous amount of detail. The action, the score and the sound effects all work to enhance the main plot and theme of the film, rather than overwhelming them. Revenge of the Sith attempts so much more than most ""popcorn"" movies in terms of pure entertainment, and thematically, it trumps many of the more ""serious"" theatric releases. All of this combines to make Revenge of the Sith far and away the best film of 2005, and maybe of the last five years. It is certainly a galaxy far, far above Million Dollar Baby, though that is saying very little."
Chronicle,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2565428/,8,"Chronicle is an engaging offspring of two very separate genres. Reality based horror / thriller movies and Super Hero's. Never would you have imagined a super hero origins movie being shot with a hand-held camera. They are often related to high octane action sequences and graphics and CGI. Well that thing doesn't change here either but the treatment is creative and thoroughly engaging. If suppose paranormal activity and any super hero movie were to mate, their offspring would have been called ""Chronicle"".I think by now the ""handheld camera"" trick in films is becoming a little stale. Sure, it can help smaller productions and can make some films visually spectacular. However, it seems that it is used in way too many films, usually horror flicks at that. Chronicle, however, is nothing less than a masterpiece at not only the ""found footage"" style, but is also a brand new way of making a superhero movie, mainly because the people it centers on are far from heroes anyway. They are portrayed as everyday people. People with real problems and psychologies. All the larger than life characters of other sci fi or super hero movie is nowhere to be seen here.Read the rest of the review at : http://devlifeintechnicolor.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/chronicle-a- realistic-take-on-sci-fi-action/"
Star Trek Into Darkness,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2795160/,3,"The Star Trek universe, resplendent in Gene Roddenberry's vision of a future wherein mankind has finally ""got its act together,"" while its social and economic problems are generally a thing of the past. Not in JJ Abrams' universe however, in which a corrupt Starfleet Admiral and a freshly revived genetically engineered 'John Harrison', an alias for a more familiar Star Trek adversary, take it upon themselves to create havoc with savage acts of treason and terrorism respectively.With seeming discount made to Roddenberry's unique take of Star Trek, evolving around the prevalent Hollywood ethos of filling seats at the local multiplex, Abrams' crafts, what I would term, a popcorn movie with plot-holes aplenty. With its target audience seated in place however, doubtlessly willing to overlook the obvious whilst simultaneously blinded by the startling visuals and 'tacked-on' 3-D (the film wasn't originally shot in 3-D, instead the process being added in post-production) this 'casual' viewer can safely check their brain at the door and, in all likelihood, enjoy...In this befuddled story, with its foot stuck firmly in Trek's The Wrath of Khan (1982), Into Darkness hauls its audience onto a seeming roller-coaster ride, dragging the viewer from one outrageous action set-piece to another, while its central characters are barely given a chance to 'grow' into their respective roles.In a likely nod to Trek VI – The Undiscovered Country, Sulu is afforded a brief turn in the captain's chair (a role which at least offered the actor some nifty poker-faced dialogue), whilst Chekov is contrastingly tucked away within the pipework-strewn bowels of the Enterprise' engine room. Scotty, meanwhile, refusing to sign for a delivery of conspicuously 'shielded' torpedoes, resigns himself into the background with his unusual but interesting little alien friend. This is clearly Kirk's film however, while his relationship with Spock (and by extension Spock's relationship with Uhura) being about the only things explored here. Worst of all however is Karl Urban's Doctor 'Bones' McCoy, who is virtually confined to pitching nostalgic-tinged quips: ""My God man, I'm a doctor not a nuclear torpedo technician,"" a character so painfully underused here – particularly given the actor's obvious talent in this role.Evolving around two villains, each of whom possessing completely different agendas, 'John Harrison' (Benedict Cumberbatch) and a warmongering Starfleet Admiral (Peter Weller), the latter of whom taking command of a freshly constructed battleship class vessel named USS VENGEANCE. Despite a promising start however, having chased Harrison to his conspicuous Klingon hideout, Kirk is somehow 'manipulated' into seeking the terrorist's help; an inconceivable decision given the character's explosive introduction - which also ignores the obvious danger he poses. And let's not forget the supposed personal anguish felt by Kirk, of which Harrison had been its mastermind. Oh well, things disintegrate further when its finally realised just how incredibly stupid Kirk has been, trusting a known terrorist whilst the viewer, during the film's final reel, is woefully pulled along during their frantic re-attempts at his capture.With an ending pulled directly out of The Wrath of Khan, albeit with Kirk and Spock on opposite sides of the radiation screen doors, I was beginning feel as though I had been robbed of my admission: the contrived nature of this protracted scene, deriving itself virtually word-for-word from its thirty-year-old original, played out while the audience undoubtedly watched in astonished déjà vu. I use the term 'contrived' given that, not unlike the life-restoring 'Genesis Planet' seen in Trek's The Search for Spock (1984), the answer to Kirk's mortal dilemma was really only a hypo-spray away...As a Trek fan, I was bitterly disappointed here: the filmmakers might well have just re-shot Nicholas Meyer's film entirely. Sincerely what an utterly shameful and wasted opportunity all this hokum was.When I emerged from the cinema, I was somewhat stunned; processing what I had just witnessed on-screen. And after having slept on it, I was finally able to articulate the next day. What I had seen wasn't so much Star Trek – a series I so dearly love and consider myself a lifelong fan of – but some cheap (albeit very expensive, costing well over £120 Million) and certainly pale imitation of a film series that deserved far better scripting and storyline than this. These wonderful characters – legendary even – each of whom a household name, whilst some having inspired many a fan to seek similar professions in the real world, reduced here to mere caricatures' of their namesakes.Over-shadowed by the film's ample and certainly showy special effects, these characters seemed stunted and confined instead of simply being allowed to develop properly.Such a shame. 3 out of 10"
Cloverfield,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1808231/,2,"Even if you can tolerate the shaky hand syndrome of an entire movie shot handy-cam, the poor dialog and weak, uninteresting plot will make you just as nauseous.Once again, with NYC as the target, aliens invade. Not right away, first you have to bear the brunt of mindless early 20's drunken banter and the scandal that one of them slept with another. You also have to believe one of these guys is wise enough to actually be promoted to an international vice-president's position, but to the film's credit, it never did say that daddy didn't own the company.Cue to the attack and as everyone is sanely leaving the city, the golden boy jeopardizes his group of friends, who stalwartly refuse to leave him, in order to rescue his scorned princess. Along their way they get plenty of reminders that they should turn around and run, but press on. Including a wildly unrealistic encounter with the military in which golden boy argues that despite countless thousands already dead, they should help him go get his girlfriend, but if they won't help him, then he must save his girlfriend and they can shoot him if they want to but he's going. Personally I wanted the military to knock him out, with drugs or by force, just so I didn't have to watch the movie any more, and perhaps the focus would change to something more interesting. The military, being the sweet, understanding people that they are known to be when under hostile fire from aliens, point him in the right direction and wish him much success.The only thing amazing about the film is the battery life on the video camera. And if the battery power had to continue, I was cheering the invaders on, to find this group and devour them just so I didn't have to listen to them anymore."
Coherence,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3010318/,10,"I was fortunate enough to catch this at a local screening in Los Angeles recently and I have to admit that this film took me completely by surprise! I knew some details before going into see this film: Low Budget, quick shooting schedule, etc. so I was preparing myself for a bit of a tough ride. I was sooooo happy to see that this was not the case AT ALL! Smart dialogue, fluid and intimate use of the camera, great characters and a storyline... it all comes together to really surprise you! Being a bit of a science nut, I also loved the fact that this storyline was ahead of the curve on a newly introduced theory making the rounds in Physics. I won't say anymore for fear of spoiling the ride, but trust me... this is a very well done film! If you still hold onto your sense of imagination... if you still believe that anything is possible... if you still love going to movies for a sense a magic and love a good story... this film will not disappoint!"
Europa Report,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2824799/,9,"Not every sci-fi movie is an action-packed super-hero popcorn flick. Luckily! And Europa Report shines among those, lately rather rare examples.Europa Report follows the line of a documentary and does that so successfully that I, throughout the movie, kept forgetting that humans actually have not yet landed on Europa. While the search for extraterrestrial is in fact the focus of the mission, it is not the focus of this movie, but rather human behavior and psychology, the magic of exploration and the steps we are ready to take for something that is larger than individual life.The story flows beautifully and, yes, with time-jumps demands full attention from the viewer. And as a consequence also delivers a great deal of excitement and enjoyment. Have the last minute or so of ""the storyteller's"" explanation and commentaries not came across a bit patronizing and unnecessary, somewhat spoiling the spirit of this pretty intelligent movie, I would consider giving it a 10.I definitely recommend to all the science, space exploration and old- school-sci-fi fans. And for those after Ironman and the Avengers - probably not a movie for you."
2010: The Year We Make Contact,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3043148/,8,"""2010 (1984)"" is a pretty good sequel to the first film ""2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)"" - both movies are worth watching.""2010 (1984)"" is a mystery that must be solved but not quite as mysterious the first movie because after watching the first film you already know something about what is going in the second film ""2010 (1984)"".""2010 (1984)"" has been badly criticized for adding the American-Russian tensions as a backdrop for the movie and is heard in the dialogue between the characters at times. I feel that if you simply watch ""2010 (1984)"" as a work of fiction while forgetting about the real life Cold War that was going on then you may enjoy ""2010 (1984)"" a lot better.Watch ""2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)"" followed by ""2010 (1984)"" for a good double feature.8/10"
Predator,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw1134922/,10,"Predator is definitely one of the best alien thrillers ever made. It is one of my personal favorite movies. When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it. The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is, and how un-humanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome, one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidi Carillo, Shane Black, and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2."
Back to the Future,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3234517/,10,"When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it."
Cube,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0490887/,10,"SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you, please listen! ****"
Demolition Man,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0320631/,7,"Sylvester Stallone was really beside himself when he took this film. Instead of trying to be the tough guy, he sort of made fun of his pre-existing persona in his role as John Spartan. Funny, and satirical of a gun-free society, it just proves that peace doesn't necessarily result in the most diverse range of self expression. The humor in the film was exceptional, and Wesley Snipes was great as Simon Phoenix. This also proved to be my favorite film with Sandra Bullock, who subsequently destroyed her career thereafter. This movie will always be good for a laugh, especially for the characters singing all of the commercial jingles."
Jurassic Park,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3260416/,10,"This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever)."
Super 8,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2442059/,1,"Wish there was a 0 rating. The movie was absolutely awful, how many times will directors try to stuff ugly alien with amazing technology down our throat.Very slow narration and build up. Reminded me of Ang Lee trying to put a personality behind The Hulk. So many loopholes in this movie , we are to believe the thing kills its victims, okay it doesn't, what does it use them for? Just too predictable. We see the thing getting out of the train in the first bit and we have to almost wait an eternity to see its ugly head again, and its not worth it. For all the hype that was thrown its way it hasn't delivered, and anyone comparing it to ET, get a grip , a bit of bottle and see the doctor. The movies are poles apart."
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw5231874/,10,"Review:
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a science-fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.
After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.
E.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.
The overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job.
With Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes.
Overall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need.
5/5"
Soylent Green,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0131837/,7,"As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . Overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ? I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . Stalin`s policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was Mao`s rural policy in China which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . And let`s not forget the great famines in the horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . You might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on Earth , Hong Kong and Macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . Likewise  the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( It`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of New York city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughableBut don`t be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because I consider this to be the best ecological film of the70s . It plays on the contempary audience`s knowledge of the world where Sol and Thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . Thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line "" If I could afford it I`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day "" . But it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as Thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world Thorn`s generation has never known . This is a very haunting scene which makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of Edward G Robinson as the wise old Jew Sol Roth"
Escape from New York,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3500927/,6,"John Carpenter's science fiction film has long been regarded as a cult classic, but after finally seeing it I find it difficult to see what all the fuss was about. What starts off as an interesting premise is wasted in a film which feels a little disjointed, and is more about visuals than anything else. It's just one sequence after another with little to recommend it in terms of special effects, acting ability, even pacing. For movie fans, there are plenty of reasons to watch ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK as it's not all that bad. The first third of the film is rather good, but the rest just lacks in momentum and comes across as slightly limp and lifeless.Kurt Russell looks cool with his eye patch and bulging muscles but doesn't have the interior toughness he brings to THE THING. The rest of the cast is exemplary, although opportunities for actual acting are limited. Mixing such old-name stars as Ernest Borgnine and Lee Van Cleef with more recent familiar faces like Harry Dean Stanton and Isaac Hayes, the whole cast really is something to die for. But...while Van Cleef is good as the chief guard, Borgnine is fairly annoying as a jovial taxi driver. Stanton is given little to do apart from walk around in a white coat and look moody, while the sole purpose for Adrienne Barbeau to be in the film is to wear a low-cut dress. Isaac Hayes is a charismatic but not-at-all fearsome villain, and Donald Pleasence is odd as the president.The action sequences, when they come, are fairly exciting, but not memorable. The best bit is in the opening where Russell is chased by a gang of mutants, this brings to mind Carpenter's earlier ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 with the grubby locations and faceless rabble of murderers (in this case cannibals). As a plus, the film does offer some excellent set design, with streets full of broken cars, rubbish etc. This kind of ""barren wasteland inhabited by mutants"" was the basis for many later rip-offs and cash-ins, especially by the Italians. The only sad thing is that while ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK could have been something brilliant, it's average at best due to a lack of ideas and originality. Not one to go out of your way for, and far surpassed in quality by many other Carpenter movies, including ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and THE THING."
Overlord,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4411300/,7,"I saw this film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and I had a good time watching it. It's a very intense movie with a lot of action throughout; it never has a moment where it calms down. I like that aspect of it but I can definitely see it being sensory overload for a lot of people. It's also quite graphic, and sometimes it's a little gratuitous and overly gory. I think the film relies a little too much on jump scares but the atmosphere is pretty creepy anyway. I think towards the end the film gets pretty over-the-top and silly, but I think it's an interesting setting and it's very well-shot and the VFX are pretty good."
Looper,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2678798/,8,"Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred, surely Y would happen, which means X wouldn't happen after all And so it is with Looper. Alas, to avoid dishing out hugely unpopular plot spoilers I need to skirt around the concerns, so you'll just have to come round with cake and we can discuss it in private. But there are some pretty substantial issues with Looper that cause questions to be asked and lead to more than a couple of possible explanations as to what exactly is going on. Don't see it alone; you'll need a friend around to discuss it on the journey home.Equally, don't be put off. You don't need to be Einstein to enjoy Looper, as some of the audience proved In 2072, time travel is both possible and illegal and murder is more easily solved because corpses are harder to lose. However mobs and Mafiosi types are prevalent and have ingeniously devised a solution: tie your victim up and send him back in time to a location where a looper will be waiting to blow his/her brains out. However, when a looper's contract is up, they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older, Old Joe (Bruce Willis) outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren't called Joe.Confused? Good. Don't think any more or you'll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like, Is he actually... Dammit.Along with the quirks, possibilities and matters left to interpretation, there are one or two clear boo-boos that cut against the rules writer/director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) has set himself. I'm sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I'm giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It's not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.There's only one way to watch Looper: suspend all disbelief, put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed, it's a superb film. No, it's not as intelligent a film as Inception, but it kicks the ass of Wanted and Gordon-Levitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.I'm not sure that I buy Gordon-Levitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn't stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He's matured as an actor and, though he's been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades, it's the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there's no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg's Lincoln and Don Jon's Addiction (which he also wrote and directed) in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.As for Willis, it's good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt (Sara) and Jeff Daniels ably provide support, the former, sadly, barely stretched and the latter, as Abe, the loopers' boss, clearly enjoying himself. Equally, Paul Dano gives a wonderful, trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to Gordon-Levitt and One Tree Hill's Pierce Gagnon as the child, Cid, whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement! There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because s/he knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn't the case with Maximum Overdrive (Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again) but with Looper it's a very strong case in point.Johnson, though he bends his rules, has created a multi-layered, rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and to-die-for quips, to wit, ""I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand."" He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause, cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint, jump or shoot-out. Though he has nothing (publicly) on the slate, there'll be plenty more from him in the next few years.As is increasingly the case, my biggest complaint with last night's viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening, namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium (big thumbs down to Cineworld) and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood, even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah, but these are niggles and hopefully you won't be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you'll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you, but if you don't mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception, then Looper is for you.Just don't think too hard. As Abe laments, ""This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an egg"" For more reviews subscribe to www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
Inception,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6388098/,10,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this."
Ex Machina,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw3240790/,3,"Spoilers ahead:Where to start with this one hmmmmm. The movie explores the already over navigated ""what if AI was created"" however unlike most movies that question should it be created this one throws you full into ""oh we did it already and here is a brief explanation on how we did it"". The premise is weak to say the least with our main characters having no real reason to be doing anything they are doing other than they can.Caleb is a young tech savy man who we learn more or less is picked to be part of an experiment with Ava and Jay. Throughout the film we learn very little about him other than he has no family and has the hots for Ava. Sadly this is the least thought out character in the film even though it depends on him to carry us through what we are watching. Jay is a genius with an apparent drinking issue and a very bland personality. His motives for making AI can basically be summed up as him wanting fame and money and that's about it. Through the film you learn these robots are ehem full functional females and yes that does mean he is sleeping with one. Aside from the otter non sense that this one man has created several robots on his own with full functional AI he gives you the ending to the film with roughly 20 mins still left in it. Whoever decided to have Jay basically say outright what if this is all a setup and then end the movie that way should be fired and kicked out of Hollywood.This brings us to Ava who honestly has nothing going for her. Shes a robot who manipulates everything and walks out as the last man standing. No reason is given for why she does what she does other then what Jay says and that's about all we know. To me the film felt rushed and incomplete neither saying why AI was created or where its going. It was simply we made robots, the robots are free and everything you wanted to happen isn't going to happen."
Source Code,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw2407982/,1,"Here's a simple review of Source Code: If you didn't like Deja Vu, with Denzel Washington, you'll probably hate Source Code. In fact, if you loved Deja Vu you'll probably still hate Source Code.SC doesn't work on any level. The explanation of the sci-fi tech is lazy - it doesn't work hard enough to warrant the suspension of disbelief you'd need to invest yourself in the story.The characters are so clichéd it's too embarrassing to even talk about them. Suffice it to say that they're phonier and more unbelievable than the quantum physics technobabble.The hero finds the bomb in the first place he looks. Yawn. The bomber is the last person he suspects but the first person Hollywood would suspect. Yawn.The super-secret, billion-dollar, experimental quantum physics project at an Air Force base is run by a nebbishy civilian professor, one technician, and Vera Farmiga. Groan.Did Jake Gyllenhall change the past in his universe, the future in a parallel universe, or what? Who cares?Howard Stern Tweeted about this movie ""it was great."" He is known for questionable taste in movies, so I wasn't sure what to do with that review. I figured going in that the lack of an exclamation point was intentional sarcasm. After seeing this turkey, I sure hope it was."
eXistenZ,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0479062/,0,"I feel compelled to speak up for this film against the spoilt ravings of the it-said-it-was-like-the-Matrix-but-I-didn't-see-any-cool-computer-graphics-a nywhere crowd that have dominated these pages.There seem to be two schools of thought on the use of special effects in movies.  The prevalent theory - depressingly common among film goers and film-makers alike - seems to be that a good effect should stand out of a film and make the audience coo like a pigeon.  If you subscribe to that theory, fine, watch the Matrix and be happy.  If you think that a special effect is a means to an end, a way to portray a fictional vista as a believable realism, then watch eXistenZ and marvel at how a grotesque and visceral world can be made so engrossingly real and intriguing.  This film has its fair share of effects, but they are so well grafted into the ethos the film evokes that you just won't notice them on first viewing.  And in contrast with the current trend towards computer-generated effects, Cronenburg knows the value of his tactile world; the physical creativity involved in the gristle-gun building scene is a fantastic example.Okay, so virtual reality has been used many times as a concept - and by films that actually came BEFORE the Matrix too - but the totality with which this film portrays its own organic brand of VR is truly engrossing.  Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are utterly watch-able and the chemistry between them is the perfect vehicle to lead an audience through the admittedly gruesome situations the film describes.There is an element of old-fashioned escapist fantasy in this film that manages to be strangely endearing despite the gore and I suggest that this is where the film triumphs - a triumph that can be attributed to clever writing, intelligent acting and characterisation, a compelling story, charismatic leads, a vivid and disciplined imagination and the discerning use of effects and visual style.If the Matrix is an `oooh, aaah' sort of film, then this is more an `oooh, eeugh' movie - but don't allow the glare of the Matrix to dull your senses to the darker appeal of eXistenZ."
Close Encounters of the Third Kind,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw0152472/,0,"An amazing film, one of my favorites. I watch this regularly, especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming, just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.Everything in this film works toward one end: to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film, designed to create confusion and startlement, this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack, the juxtaposition of images, they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn't right, that something out of the ordinary is taking place, and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist, to pull away from, to not allow it to affect one's ""ordinary life."" But as the movie progresses, the tone begins to shift, and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn't about being afraid of the unknown, but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the ""subliminal images"" in life, allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous, only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.Dreyfuss' character takes us on this journey, met with resistance all along the way. His wife, his neighbors, his job, his community, all are working against him, and it's only when he's reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand, but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place, and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.The ending of this film, when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience, brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the ""adult"" sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary, one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. Powerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating. I highly recommend this film for anyone jaded with life and seeking a sense of renewal."
Avengers: Endgame,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw4802892/,10,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
Avengers: Infinity War,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw6775581/,10,"As epic and satisfying as Endgame was, I think the true peak of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Infinity War. The brilliant weaving-together of characters from such different corners of the universe into their unique storylines, the incredible examination of Thanos as an actual character in the story, top-tier visuals and action, and a final sequence that is absolutely gut-wrenching and powerful: this film will always stand above the rest for me. The Empire Strikes Back of Marvel films. 10/10."
